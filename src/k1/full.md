# KOTOR 1 Full Build

## Installation Instructions

If you were linked to this list directly without reading the install instructions, please go back and read them [here](/modding/mod_builds/index.html). There are some setup and general best-practice steps you need to be aware of before beginning the install process.

### Before Installing

Please make sure that your main game directory and all subfolders are *not* set as read-only. Executable mods will need to modify the files therein directly to install properly. Windows often locks the settings on these folders, so for many systems it will not be possible to actually pull them out of their read-only state, but I still recommend at least attempting to change the folders, as on some operating systems this step is critical for a functional install.

It is critical to ensure that you only have **ONE** installation of KOTOR on your device before beginning. If you have multiple installations, or even just two executables in different locations, TSLPatcher executables which are set up to auto-detect your installation directory *will* misidentify which one is correct and install the mods wherever they please, probably spiking your whole install in the process. If you want to make a backup of your vanilla gamestate, make sure to compress the entire game into an archive before starting the install process.

Please also note that the TSLPatcher executable utilized in the installation process of many of these mods (frustratingly) does not function on multi-monitor setups. If you have more than one monitor, you will need to disable your second while installing the mods, but you can re-enable it once the installation process is complete.

Do not, under **ANY CIRCUMSTANCES**, run the TSLPatcher executable from within a file archive (.rar, .7z, etc.). You *must* extract all archives before installing mod content, or running the TSLPatcher executable. Failure to extract before installing will break your game.

As a final note, please bear in mind: if you are asked to direct a TSLPatcher executable to a folder to begin install, that folder should ALWAYS be the main game folder, where your game's .exe file is located (or the symlink to that folder created in the Quicker TSLPatching step below). For mods that are NOT installed with the TSLPatcher, *unless otherwise noted* their loose-file contents are most often placed directly in the Override directory. Unless you are following specific instructions (the mod author's or my own) that state otherwise, you should not be placing files in the game's main directory or Modules folder. You should *never* have any subfolders inside the Modules or Override folders.

### Known Bugs

* The intro cutscene to the game can sometimes fail to play when running with upscaled movies and widescreen applied. Just watch a clip of the cutscene elsewhere if it happens to you.
* Sometimes the game will crash on load when trying to enter a new area due to a data overflow. This is unfortunately basically unavoidable even with the smallest-resolution upscales, but easy to fix when it happens. Simply temporarily disable the 'Frame Buffer Effects' setting in your advanced graphics options, proceed through the load screen, then re-enable the setting once on the other side.
* It appears as if the first interaction between Elora (Sunry's wife) and the party on Manaan might skip through some dialogue if Jolee is in the party. This has only occurred once—please let me know if it happens to you.

### Updating from a Prior Build

If you currently have a prior mod build version installed and would like to update to the current Revision, due to the importance of install order to the mod builds' function, there is unfortunately no way to do so without resetting to a fresh install and reinstalling the new build iteration on top. To do this, you will need to uninstall your game, then navigate to the game's install folder and delete any remaining contents; frequently, especially on the Steam release of the game, mod content *will not* be uninstalled as part of the application's uninstallation, or wiped when the game is reinstalled. If you do not both uninstall the game *and* wipe the directory prior to reinstalling, contents of the prior build can be left over upon the new build's installation and can lead to fatal errors during the install.

### AMD Players

For some godforsaken reason, AMD cards are frequently crashing on current versions of KOTOR. While this doesn't happen on all AMD card types, if you get into the game and start experiencing random crashes while walking around and you've got an AMD card, sadly this is probably why. There is a solution, but it requires you to roll your driver version back to a set released prior to July 15th. I cannot give advice on how to do this, as the process is unique to your particular graphics card and I don't personally own an AMD device. Googling your graphics card and 'drivers' will probably get you where you need to go.

### Mac OS Players

Please see [this link](/modding/mod_builds/macos.html) for installation assistance for the game and these mods.

### Amazon Games Players

For unknown reasons, the Amazon Games version of KOTOR has a modified executable and initiation file which breaks the Miles sound system, and automatically disables both movies and sound. Follow the steps [here](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2377-amazon-gamess-k1-release-soundsmovies-fix/) to restore these features. It's okay to do this now even if you intend to patch widescreen in later, just bear in mind when you do move to patch in widescreen that you already have the editable executable downloaded.

### Linux Players

For anyone attempting to install these builds on a Linux distro, I strongly recommend installing on a case-insensitive file system (I have had VFAT recommended as an option by other users). Otherwise you will need to go through the headache of renaming a huge number of files, and it's really not worth it.

### Total Filesize on Disk

For your reference, the total filesize of all mods before extraction, excluding movies, is approximately 6GB. Please bear this in mind if you intend to keep backups and/or are operating on a system with limited available memory. The total size of the install when extracted (plus HD movies in 1920x1080 resolution) is approximately 16GB.

## Mod List

### Quicker TSLPatching

**Name:** [Quicker TSLPatching](https://www.nexusmods.com/kotor/mods/1214?tab=description)

**Author:** xypherh

**Description:** This isn't a game mod, but rather a system workaround which makes it easier to install mods. This script *will not work* on Mac operating systems (neither Linux, I believe) not running Windows on a partition, but there are some comments in the Posts section of the download page that might offer alternatives that allow it to function properly.

Mods will frequently use the TSLPatcher installer, which often requires you to point the installer at your game's base installation directory. Sometimes the patchers do this automatically, but sometimes they fail, which is where this script comes in; it'll create a symlink to your KOTOR and KOTOR 2 install directories direct to your desktop, where the TSLPatcher defaults to pointing, so you only need to scroll down and click the folder to install without navigating through your system's file structure. The script is confirmed safe and once your install is complete you can delete the desktop folders with no problems.

**Installation Method:** Windows Registry Edit

**Installation Instructions:** Run the script and follow the instructions it presents, choosing your KOTOR directory in the first popup window and your KOTOR 2 directory in the second. If the script does not function for you, check the Posts section of the mod download page to see some alternate suggestions for manually forcing the functionality of the script.

**Author:** Salk & Kainzorus Prime

**Description:** In addition to fixing several typos, this mod takes the PC's dialogue—which is written in such a way as to make the PC sound constantly shocked, stupid, or needlessly and overtly evil—and replaces it with more moderate and reasonable responses, even for DS choices.

**Category & Tier:** Immersion / 1 - Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** NO

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Installation Instructions:** Move the dialogue.tlk file from the "PC Response Moderation" folder into the main KOTOR directory (where the executable file is).

**Author:** jonathan7, patch by A Future Pilot

**Description:** In a normal KOTOR start, your character's feats are pre-selected. This mod changes the initial level-up so that the number of feat points given is determined by class, but you can choose the feats you wish to invest into.

**Category & Tier:** Mechanics Change / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** TSLPatcher, Loose-File Patch

**Usage Warning:** It's possible, if using auto level-up, to miss the feats to equip weapons and basic light armor while using this mod, unless you use the patch. Make sure to install it!

**Category & Tier:** Bugfix & Graphics Improvement / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Installation Instructions:** Move everything from the Straight Fixes, Resolution Fixes, and Aesthetic Improvements folders to your Override.

The fix in the Bugfix folder will be applied by a later mod, so you can also skip it.

### Ultimate Character Overhaul

**Name:** [Ultimate Character Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/kotor/mods/1282?)

**Author:** ShiningRedHD

**Description:** Ultimate Character Overhaul is a comprehensive AI-upscale of every character and piece of equipment in the game. Unlike previous AI upscales, the Ultimate series has no transparency problems while still retaining reflections on character textures, all without any additional steps required. This is an incredibly high-quality mod, and ShiningRed has even gone through the trouble to make compatibility patches for the mod builds, upscaling some of the later textures we use!

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 1 - Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Installation Instructions:** For now, ignore all patches (those will be installed later). Just download the main package, and MAKE SURE it is the .tpc file version! I recommend the 2k version for the best combination of performance and quality.

Before moving the files to the override folder, be sure to delete the following: PFBI01 through PFBI04, and PMBI01 through PMBI04.

Move your preferred textures from one of those folders (or one of their sub-folders for optional Sith eyes) to your override, then download and run the patch to finish applying changes. Do NOT move any of the files in the main mod folder!

**Author:** Various Authors; Darth Parametric, JCarter426 & A Future Pilot Collate

**Description:** An ambitious compilation intending to be a comprehensive bugfix mod for the original game, the KOTOR Community Patch combines hundreds of various fixes and improvements from over a dozen other mods, as well as fixes put together by AFP, DP and JC on their own. With bugfixes as important to KOTOR as TSLRCM's are to KOTOR 2, I can't recommend its use highly enough.

**Category & Tier:** Bugfix, Graphics Improvement & Immersion / 1 - Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** NO

**Installation Method:** HoloPatcher Mod

**Installation Instructions:** Be aware that this mod is the only one in the builds that is installed via the HoloPatcher, a new install method.

**Description:** This is the first in a series of high-resolution player heads from Dark Hope, complete with full Dark Side transitions and new player portraits. We aren't going to use all of the HD versions she made—I've been careful to only select those I think fit closely with the original player head, as well as making enough clear improvements that any aesthetic alterations are acceptable trade-offs for the improved texture quality.

This specific texture reskins the fifth Asian male head preset, including new facial hair.

**Name:** [Thigh-High Boots for Twi'lek](http://deadlystream.com/files/file/1087-k1-thigh-high-boots-for-female-twilek-body-modders-resource/)

**Author:** DarthParametric

**Description:** In vanilla, female Twi'lek's thigh-high boots are painted on the character's texture rather than added to their equipped clothing as an item, which would give them realistic three-dimensional depth and higher resolution. This modder's resource serves to add the boots as an equipped object.

**Author:** Watcher07

**Description:** Recolors Calo Nord's clothing to be more muted in tone; you wouldn't expect a famous bounty hunter to run around in bright colors, would you? Note that this does not allow you to play as Calo, nor does it add the custom blaster skin or republic uniform skin seen in the screenshots.

**Description:** If you preferred the robes in KOTOR 2, as most seem to, does JC have a mod for you. Cloaked Jedi Robes migrates all of the robe types from KOTOR 2 straight into KOTOR, while still managing to retain the unique color schemes of the original (should you choose to use one of the two options for that, anyway!). If you've long sought robe consistency across the two games, look no further.

**Author:** Heyorange

**Description:** If you ever want a window into incredibly minor things that I think are really cool, this is the cream of the crop. Vanilla KOTOR doesn't really have much rhyme or reason behind differentiating the appearance of the Sith soldiers you encounter, except for rule of cool.

### Reflective Lightsaber Blades

**Name:** [New Lightsaber Blade Models](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1846-new_lightsaber_blade_model_k1/)

**Author:** Crazy34

**Description:** With this mod, Crazy34 walked into the community, slammed down one of the most impressive mods ever made for this game, and dared us to do better. Not only have they split the blade texture in two to allow for lightsabers with cores of a different color (currently unsupported in the build release, but hopefully coming soon), they've also added *dynamic reflections* to each and every lightsaber across every area of the game. When you're fighting a Dark Jedi, you're going to see your faces bathed in shifting colors, fading and brightening as you swing your lightsabers; when you ignite your saber in a hallway, it will reflect on the floor and walls, and will realistically increase in intensity as the blade draws nearer to the surface. This is an incredible project, and easily one of the most important—and impressive—mods ever released for KOTOR. In the next few years, it could completely change the face of lightsaber modding.

### Ixgil the Bith

**Name:** [Ixgil the Bith](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2108-ixgil-the-bith/)

**Author:** Crimson Knight

**Description:** The definition of modding hubris. When the power to change the universe at the tips of one's fingers leads a man to spend more time making a mod than the combined thousands of users who ever download it will even see what he did on screen.

There's a wrong soundset. This mod fixes it. The character dies about 5 seconds later. To even download this mod is to question one's sanity.

**Description:** Pazaak players in the original KOTOR cheat, badly. While there's no way to prevent the computer from favoring NPCs in draws, there is a way to drastically reduce their ability to help themselves, and that's to give them all decks one tier lower than what their difficulty says they should have.

**Name:** [Ebon Hawk Camera Replacement](http://deadlystream.com/files/file/827-ebon-hawk-camera-replacement/)

**Author:** LDR

**Description:** By default, the camera angle inside the *Ebon Hawk* is ridiculously close to the PC, which not only makes the PC take up the majority of the screen, it also makes it very hard to see around you. This mod replaces the *Ebon Hawk* camera angle with one closer to the camera angles present in the rest of the game, and similar to KOTOR 2's *Ebon Hawk* camera angle.

**Author:** jc2

**Description:** In the base-game, grenades typically aren't very useful after the first few planets, once Force powers and the PC's combat capabilities begin to spin up. This mod seeks not only to increase the value of grenades throughout the game but to also make the enemies wielding them more dangerous by tying the total damage output of a grenade to the demolitions stat of the thrower.

### Repeater Attacks Restoration

**Name:** [Repeating Blaster Attacks Restoration](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1405-repeating-blaster-attacks-restoration/)

**Author:** R2-X2

**Description:** Blasters in the original KOTOR are underpowered all-around, but out of the entire laughingstock none is worse than blaster repeaters, which cost more in return for equivalent damage and less crit chance. It turns out that these weapons were originally supposed to have two attack rounds, but BioWare didn't have the time or know-how to implement this before the game went gold. This mod restores this function, with only a few instances where it doesn't work due to hardcoded scripting.

**Category & Tier:** Mechanics Change & Bugfix / 1- Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Known Bugs:** Sometimes it appears as if the damage for this mod does not apply properly; it appears to function sometimes and fail at others. This is a very complicated mod which makes it difficult to trace the problems, but having this fixed at least *some* of the time is better than not having it fixed at all.

**Installation Instructions:** The two optional files included in this mod package are untested with the builds and, from a balance perspective, not recommended.

This mod leaves Trask in with all of his usual actions in the prologue, but removes all of his explanatory dialogue about how the game works.

### Dark Sacrifice

**Name:** [JC's Romance Enhancement: Dark Sacrifice](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2225-jcs-romance-enhancement-dark-sacrifice-for-k1/)

**Author:** JCarter426

**Description:** As you know, with some small variations KOTOR has a binary ending: Light Side or Dark Side. But it wasn't always so—until quite late in development a very unique ending for Dark Side players who romanced Carth was still being developed, and voice lines were even recorded for it. For unknown reasons this ending was cut, but with this mod it has now been restored. You are not locked into this alternate ending, it's only presented as an option which your character may choose. More than this can't be revealed without giving the ending away, but do note that unless you intend to play as a DS character capable of romancing Carth, this mod will not present any changes. Please also note, a third-party mod by Leilukin not present in this guide makes Carth able to be romanced by male characters, and is compatible with this mod.

**Name:** [Saber Throw Knockdown Effect](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1487-k1-saber-throw-knockdown-effect/)

**Author:** uwadmin12

**Description:** By default, the "Throw Lightsaber" power is a little weak. Not only does it seem like it takes forever, it does much less damage in a much smaller AoE than powers like Lightning—or even Wave! The goal of this mod is giving Advanced Throw Lightsaber some additional functionality that makes using it worthwhile, namely the inclusion of a knockdown effect on the primary target if that target fails to pass a saving throw. This can make the ability useful for screening particular zones while also dealing damage—still somewhat less effective than Wave, but with more guaranteed damage.

**Name:** [PC Dialogue with Davik's Slave Change](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2214-pc-dialogue-with-daviks-slaves-change/)

**Author:** Leilukin

**Description:** 2003 was a different time, but this mod *really* proves that. In vanilla, if you request a 'massage' from some slaves—which has some sexual implications in Star Wars—you get nothing more than a disgusted remark from some companions. You can even threaten them without consequence. This mod properly amends this, giving you two options: for those deeply bothered by the ability to take advantage of the slaves the option to pressure them into servicing you can be removed entirely, whereas the second retains the massage, but gives Dark Side points for requesting it, as well as adding DS points for threatening the slaves at any point.

Dialogue was present in the files indicating that this was always meant to have been an option, but for some reason was scrapped from the final release. You can now buy T3 as soon as you're ready and use him until you unlock Mission, Zalbaar, and your other party members.

**Description:** In all BioWare's infinite brilliance, when they ported KOTOR to PC they didn't just cap the menus to 800x600, they also broke security spikes so they're literally unusable. This mod can't fix that, but it *can* give you a workaround: either some hacky functionality that works just like spikes do, or cold, hard cash in the places where spikes would normally drop.

**Name:** [A Crashed Republic Cruiser on a Nameless World](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1878-a-crashed-republic-cruiser-on-a-nameless-world/)

**Author:** LDR

**Description:** It's difficult for me to talk about this mod without gushing about it. In my opinion, this mod is the *best* piece of added quest content ever made for either KOTOR or KOTOR 2: best-written, best-structured, best-balanced, best-voiced, and most sensible. It brings the player's past into the equation without mandating anything about their nature, and provides a real and immersive look at what your character's past was, and future could be, all while being lore-friendly to **BOTH** KOTOR 2 and The Old Republic. The only reason this mod isn't marked as Essential is because it reuses one module in a way which doesn't allow for suspension of disbelief—everything else about this mod is perfect.

**Author:** Shem, patch by A Future Pilot & Darth Parametric

**Description:** Sherruk, the Mandalorian leader on Dantooine, likes to collect the lightsabers of the Jedi whom he's killed, and the settlers on the plains tell you that he's been heard to use them in battle. With this mod he really does use those lightsabers—and an impressively expanded inventory of equipment—to fuck your shit up.

**Description:** By default, the forcefield in the Kashyyyk shadowlands doesn't have any point of interaction to it, and so to get around this oversight BioWare had to use some camera trickery to prevent the player from seeing what Jolee was doing.

**Description:** Datapad, datapad, datapad, datapad, datapad. You wouldn't be able to tell it by looking at them, but in vanilla those are five different items. No more.

### Remove Duplicate TGA/TPC

**Name:** [Remove Duplicate TGA/TPC](https://www.nexusmods.com/kotor/mods/1384) OR [Bash script for MacOS/Linux](https://pastebin.com/6WCN122S)

**Author:** Flachzangen, bash version by /u/th3w1zard1

**Description:** This is a script written by Flachzangen which allows you to remove duplicate .TGA or .TPC files in your game directory. Files with the .TPC filetype take priority, so for several of the patches we've downloaded which are of the .tga filetype, we need to delete any .TPC duplicates in order to get them to read properly. That's what this script will do.

**Category & Tier:** Patch / 1 - Essential

**Installation Method:** .bat Patcher

**Installation Instructions:** Place DelDuplicateTGA-TPC (or the bash script version) in your main game folder (NOT override!), run it, say that TPC should be deleted and do not manually confirm. If you are on a Mac or other device that cannot run .bat files and the bash script is not an option for you to use, a list of all the files you will need to manually delete can be found [here](/modding/mod_builds/k1/delete.html). **MAKE SURE THIS SCRIPT RUNS PROPERLY!

On some operating systems, overzealous antivirus setups, or filepaths with particular characters in them it may fail. If the file outputs "Finished, Press any key to continue" but does not list any files it deleted, it *is not working*, and if it does not work it *will* crash your game. You can try to resolve this by moving your Override folder to a different location (I recommend a subfolder in your Documents or Downloads directories), putting the .bat file there and running it through that directory, but if that doesn't work you will need to manually go through and delete the duplicates from the link above.

### 4GB Patcher

**Name:** [4GB Patcher](https://ntcore.com/?page_id=371)

**Author:** Daniel Pistelli

**Description:** This is a program which modifies your game's executable file to be able to utilize up to 4 gigabytes of RAM, since KOTOR is a 32-bit application and by default can only utilize 2 gigabytes. This will help the game run smoothly even with the larger texture throughput this build creates, and also reduces issues caused by a memory leak which is native to the game, preventing crashes and savegame corruption.

**Category & Tier:** Patch / 1 - Essential

**Installation Method:** Executable

**Installation Instructions:** If you intend to add widescreen support, *proceed to the below section and* **FULLY** *apply your chosen widescreen resolution* **AND** *all additional widescreen support mods you choose to use* **BEFORE** *completing this step*. Once you are done applying all your chosen widescreen content, you are then free to apply this patch.

Additionally, **DO NOT** apply this step with the Steam version of the game, unless you have applied the below widescreen patch! Without the modified widescreen .exe, Steam's executable copy is encrypted in such a way that executing this patcher will break it and prevent the game from launching. Although it's unfortunate to not have access to the patch, it doesn't introduce any fatal errors or shortcomings if you are on Steam and choose not to apply widescreen so it can be used; I recommend just being sure to exit your game and restart the application from the top once every four hours or so!

## Optional Widescreen

If you want support for widescreen resolutions above 1280x1024, it's highly recommended that you follow the instructions presented in the following video. By using UniWS, you also avoid many of the issues caused by FlawlessWidescreen, including savegame corruption:

[KOTOR Widescreen Patch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SKMzwKE34E)

Please ensure your desktop scaling is set to **100%**—not higher, not lower—to ensure that the widescreen functionality displays properly in-game. On some operating systems, this can be avoided by right-clicking the application, going to compatibility, selecting Change High DPI Settings, and setting the override to be scaled by the application. If your OS does not allow this function, you will need desktop scaling set at 100%.

Also note that, upon application of widescreen, *you will need to launch the game directly from the executable from that point on*. This means, for instance, not launching the game through the Steam interface. This is due to the edits made by widescreen which break the handshake between Steam and the executable.

### Widescreen Bugfixes & Extended Support Mods

Following the application of basic widescreen support, if you would like additional widescreen support mods (including menus above 800x600 and high-resolution cutscenes), or if you've ever had the fullscreen bug (game crashing when playing cutscenes + general instability), see [**here**](/modding/mod_builds/k1/widescreen.html) for additional mods and methods which can improve widescreen and fix the fullscreen bug.

## Misc. Basegame Issues & Fixes

### Crash After Character Creation

This is a common issue which users tend to think is caused by the mod builds, but 99.9% of the time you don't have a mod error, and this is a basegame issue. Sometimes the game refuses to load when you have the Frame Buffer Effects setting enabled, so just disabling it in your Advanced Graphics Options ingame will allow you to load the game.

### Character Stuck After Combat

This isn't a bug that modding can fix (or cause), it's an engine bug. It's related to the game's framerate being unsynced with your monitor's refresh rate. If you're on a 60hz monitor, you can just toggle v-sync. If you're 144hz or similar, just set your monitor to 60hz manually for the duration of play and also toggle v-sync.

### Grass

If you have issues with objects disappearing behind grass or grass not rendering properly, [this page](http://steamcommunity.com/app/32370/discussions/0/41973821366855313/) purports to have a fix. I have not tested it personally, but users with grass issues report that it fixes the rendering problems—*however*, they also report that it will render many textures partially transparent. Disabling grass in the .ini will also fix rendering issues with grass, and is what I recommend, but this is an option for those who wish to avoid that, to be taken at their own risk.

### Swoop Racing

Although I don't recommend staying in compatibility mode for Windows XP SP3 long-term, as it can result in some crashes on load screens (which can be resolved in turn by disabling Frame Buffer Effects in your .ini, though that's not ideal either), sometimes swoop racing can mess up in a way that makes it necessary. If you find your swoop bike floating several meters off the track, exit the game and launch it in compatibility mode for XP SP3. You should be able to race normally, and you can turn off the compatibility mode after the racing segment is over.
