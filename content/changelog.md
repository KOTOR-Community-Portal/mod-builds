# Mod Build Changelog

Please bear in mind that this changelog only reflects major "Revision-level" updates and immediate hotfixes which follow them; constant iteration work and support are performed on the mod builds over the course of their lifetime, so don't let a seeming lack of updates be a cause for concern! If you want to see how frequently the install instructions are amended, you can check how recently the Nexus versions have had their downloads section updated.

## 2025

### 11/03/2025

The "Aspyr Patch" build release. Revision 12 was originally intended to be released significantly later, in 2026, after the development of several new mods designed specifically for use in the mod builds. Mounting problems with applying widescreen to unpatched copies of KOTOR 2, however, as well as advances in fixing many of the broken parts of the Aspyr patch (AKA the current patch version of KOTOR 2 on GoG/Steam), encouraged us to move up our release schedule and refocus this Revision on improving the Aspyr patch of the game to make it a functional standard for players. As a happy coincidence, this also allowed us to catch up on a backlog of KOTOR mods to be tested, as it had fallen behind KOTOR 2 by almost six months due to the long delays while developing Revision 11.

Highlights include:
1. As usual, dozens of new mods for both games have been integrated
2. Integration of J's series of fixes to the Aspyr patch of KOTOR 2, including the 3C-FD patcher; water fix; lightsaber fixes; and lightmap fixes.
3. Inclusion of Redrob's 2k AI upscales of characters for both games, which were done with AI as a base but then manually worked-over, and include model fixes to enhance their display ingame even further. Redrob is a veteran skinnner and model editor, and his work is extremely high-quality.
4. Offthegridmorty's Force tweaks for both games (Alignment Affects Force Powers & Repair Affects Stun Droids), as well as the very scary True Sith Assassins for KOTOR 2.
5. Functional autofire and multifire options for ranged weapons in KOTOR, courtesy of darthbdaman.
6. The absolutely *incredible* TSL Expanded Ending mod by Wildkarrde, which links several plot points which were still left hanging in the wind with TSLRCM, as well as making the ending feel more coherent and much less sudden.

26. Character Textures & Model Fixes

Modified:

2. Sith Uniform Reformation replaced by Sith Uniform Reformation Reformed, a more compatible and installer-based version of the mod with further enhancements.
3. Isolated some crashes caused by models (current reason unknown) in Unique Sith Governor & Movie-Style Endgame Holograms for MacOS/Linux players: added warnings.
4. Added a patch to HQ Skyboxes to fix some minor rendering issues through windows

Removed:
1. Party Model Fixes I & II: superseded by Character Textures & Model Fixes
2. HD Rakghouls: superseded by Character Textures & Model Fixes
3. Scoundrel Trouser Fix: even if Redrob didn't fix the wedgie on the model, I prefer to have his model fixes and textures than the previous very low-res texture with other errors on the model. So, effectively, superseded by Character Textures & Model Fixes
4. Improved Grenades: superceded by Rebalanced Grenades
5. Weapon Stats Rebalance: superseded by changes made by JC in JC's Blaster Adjustment + darthbdaman in his repeater fixes. I also disliked some of the later changes made to WSR and think these other mods change things more in line with the original intent & balance
6. Sith Uniform Disguise Extension: current implementation is buggy, removed pending update/alternate implementation


**KOTOR 2:**

New Inclusions:
1. Classic Class Attack Bonus

Modified:
1. Bugfixes to Thematic KOTOR 2 Companions which left the Sith Assassin edition of Visas with much higher skill points than she should have had

Removed:
1. No Mines on Malachor, Only Gas: integrated into Morty's mine enhancement
2. Crazy's New Lightsaber Blade Model: superceded by J's Enhanced Lightsaber Hilt Variety
3. Luxa Fix: integrated & improved in Redrob's Model and Texture Fixes
4. Player & Party Underwear: mostly integrated in Redrob's Model & Texture Fixes
5. Player & Party Underwear + UCO Patch: ditto above
6. Treat Injury Affects Force Healing: Integrated into Alignment Affects Force Powers


### 03/11/2025

With apologies for the very long delay, we are back! Revision 11 is now live. This Revision marks the beginning of a paradigm shift in the design of the mod builds, refocusing on integrating content created specifically for the mod builds (this, coincidentally, is why this release took so long—we were making mods!). While we will always include any new content we see that we believe meets the mod builds' standards, henceforth we are going to be placing a much greater emphasis on bringing in content intentionally designed to compliment the mod builds. This Revision is a bit of a hybrid between the two concepts, but the next Revision will focus heavily on custom content. But that's for the future!

This Revision's highlights include:

1. As usual, integration of several dozen mods for both games
2. Integration of a new, extremely high-quality HD cutscene package, so crisp it blows even the previous HD cutscenes away
3. The creation & integration of several "Thematic"-series mods by JC and myself, including our (thus far) magnum opus—KOTOR 2's "TOMB"
4. Fixing of a particularly long-lived and vexing lighting issue on Taris that made many of the surfaces painfully reflective

## 2023

### 10/9/2023

1. Sunsetting of Reddit support for the mod builds. The mod builds are now principally hosted offsite on kotor.neocities.org, with satellite hosting continuing as Steam guides; the builds themselves, as well as support for them, will no longer take place on reddit. Primary support migrated to the Discord at https://discord.gg/kotor

## 2022

### 12/25/2022

1. Merry Christmas! A new piece of restored content by JC, an alternate ending for DS characters who romance Carth, has been integrated!


### 12/9/2022

1. Several dozen new mods across both games.

2. Several mods for KOTOR which also work for KOTOR 2 have now been integrated into the KOTOR 2 build list, to make the games more visually consistent across builds and improve overall graphical fidelity.

2. Added information on all mods indicating how they are installed (loose-file, TSLPatcher, etc.) and whether or not they are compatible with non-English game versions. De facto, this now makes the builds compatible with non-English game versions, although for the moment, out of necessity, several mods must be skipped when not playing in English.

3. Conversion of all .tga-based upscale mods to .tpc, saving several GBs of download size and space on disk.

4. Thanks to further collaboration with ShiningRed, tightened up the AI upscale mods to remove the last problem textures, and integrated most of the Nar Shaddaa upscale, which was previously excluded.

5. Offsite support: the mod builds are now hosted on both the Nexus and on Steam as Steam Guides, not just reddit.

___

### 4/13/2022

After the most implausible series of delays and problems I've ever encountered, *finally*, the new build release is out! Highlights follow:

1. Fully supported mobile builds!

2. Complete and fully-tested AI upscales of almost all areas and characters for both games!

3. Dynamic lightsaber lighting & reflections for both games in all game areas.

4. The inclusion of LDR's amazing *A Crashed Ship on an Unknown World* mod for KOTOR, in my opinion the best piece of added content ever made for these games, hands-down.

## 2020

### 2/1/2020

1. After careful consideration, I've ceased support for Jorak Uln's Endar Spire Overhaul and Sith Base Overhaul mods, and lowered the priority of Telos ORIGINS to Optional. I feel these mods modify the base aesthetic too much to allow for a visually coherent experience, and the game is best-served by removing them.

## 2019

### 12/20/2019

1. Integrated changes from the recent update to the KOTOR 2 Community Patch.

___

### 12/19/2019

1. New builds, just in time for the holidays (and the movie, but who cares about that).

2. Migrated the mod builds themselves to four separate reddit wiki pages, to deal with issues of space. And Chrome lagging every time I tried to open the build thread.

3. Integrated AI-upscaled cutscenes for both games thanks to the work of /u/naelavok!

4. Swapped out Handmaiden for Females/Disciple for Males for PartySwap, which allows you to get both the Handmaiden and Disciple in a single playthrough!

5. Integrated optional 3D directional sound for both games.

## 2018

### 6/29/2018

1. Replaced Robes for Korriban Sith Students by Shem with Korriban: Back in Black by JCarter426, which is a much more vanilla-friendly interpretation.

___

### 6/15/2018

1. Updated K1 and K2 builds—my present for the merger!

2. Updated all MEGA-hosted mods which have received base mod updates since the last build update. The delay in maintaining these files was an oversight which I'll make sure doesn't happen again.

3. Integrated additional widescreen support for KOTOR 1—we now have widescreen menus! The old 800x600 static menus are now a thing of the past for players using UniWS!

4. Fully removed the TSL Overhaul mod. The previous build used only about 75% of its modules in a test state to see if balance could be enhanced while removing the most egregious problems, but in this test I found the loot lists were still wildly out of balance. I regret that so many players experienced the game under my recommendation with this mod installed, even after I added the balance warnings to it I did; I hope to improve in the future and ensure that a mod that so massively alters balance such as this does not make its way onto these builds again.

## 2017

### 12/29/2017

1. Removed Marauder mods which were integrated into the Marauder Fix Pack from the K2 Build.

___

### 9/15/2017

1. Brand-new builds for KOTOR and KOTOR 2!

2. Temporarily moved the TSLRCM download from Deadly Stream to ModDB.

3. Significantly modified the Overhaul TSL modules utilized in the KOTOR 2 builds, and entirely removed it from the spoiler-free builds; my sincerest apologies for the unbalanced experience which the last build provided. The current build, while still somewhat (although less) unbalanced in terms of loot, is now fully balanced for realistic combat difficulty.

___

### 1/9/2017

1. Extended Enclave back to full support after isolating an issue caused by using it alongside Overhaul TSL.

## 2016

### 9/19/2016

1. Plugged in SithSpecter's High Quality Blasters for TSL.

___

### 9/9/2016

1. New builds once again for KOTOR 1 & KOTOR 2!

2. Implementation of a mod category system in addition to the tier system; now you can see what category a mod's changes fall into and its tier side-by-side.

3. Implemented some mods from the Nexus, and migrated some downloads from my MEGA backups to Nexus equivalents with screenshots.

___

### 8/20/2016

1. Builds are up and supported again!

2. New builds for KOTOR 1 & KOTOR 2!

3. Full host migration. All non-Deadly Stream mods are now hosted on MEGA.

4. Implementation of a mod "tier system." I now make it more clear which mods I believe are important to use for the best experience and which are optional.

5. Heavily reworked the installation framework of the builds. Now includes:

* More obvious author attribution

* A new tier system designed to better inform users about my opinion of the quality/importance of every individual mod to the build as a whole

* More detailed download & installation instructions

* Screenshots (for those mods that don't have them and which I could procure; more screenshots forthcoming in the next build)

___

### Pre-2016

Changelogs prior to 8/20/2016 were not kept, but the mod builds were shared in early forms as far back as 2009, and they first appeared on reddit in May of 2013 (Release) and underwent four major Revisions before changes began to be tracked.
