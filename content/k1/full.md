# KOTOR 1 Full Build

## Installation Notes

### IMPORTANT!

If you were linked to this list directly without reading the install instructions, please go back and read them [here](/modding/mod_builds/index.html)! There are several critical setup and general best-practice steps you need to be aware of before beginning the install process. The instructions for how this list is installed are located on that page, not this build!

### Zeroing Step

Unless you have *freshly* installed the game or have never installed KOTOR previously, please blank-slate your setup: uninstall the game, delete the full contents of your game's directory (the entire folder where the executable file previously was located; this does **NOT** always happen automatically when the game is uninstalled), and reinstall the game. The majority of troubleshooting support we offer is due to users who encounter problems resulting from leftover game files or file corruption from a game which was installed many years ago. Performing this zeroing step helps to ensure your local copy is fresh, uncorrupted, and free of any old mod data.

Once you have your freshly-installed copy of the game, please attempt to set your main game directory and all subfolders as *not* read-only. This is because executable mods will need to modify the files therein directly to install properly. Some operating systems (particularly Windows OS 8+) will lock the settings on these folders depending on their locations, so for many systems it will not be possible to actually pull them out of their read-only state, but it is important to at at least attempt to change the folders, as on some operating systems it is possible, and therefore necessary for a functional install.

### TSLPatcher Installation Requirements

Do not, under **ANY CIRCUMSTANCES**, run a TSLPatcher or HoloPatcher executable from within a file archive (IE a compressed file like a .rar, .zip, .7z, etc). You *must* extract all archives before installing mod content, or running an executable. Failure to extract before installing will break your game. Also, ensure you don't extract all the mods to the exact same folder. If, for example, you extract every single mod to a folder called "KOTOR Mods" and run the executable each time, each time you extract you'll be overwriting critical data from the previous mods. Make sure each installer-based mod is extracted to its own folder before running the installer.

Please also bear in mind: if you are asked to direct a TSLPatcher or Holopatcher executable to a folder to begin install, that folder should ALWAYS be the main game folder, where your game's .exe file is located (or the symlink to that folder created in the optional Quicker TSLPatching step, discussed further below). For mods that are NOT installed with the TSLPatcher or Holopatcher, *unless otherwise noted* their loose-file contents are placed directly in the Override directory. Unless you are following specific instructions (the mod author's or my own) that state otherwise, you should not be placing files in the game's main directory or Modules folder. You should *never* have any subfolders inside the Modules or Override folders.

As a final note, be aware that the TSLPatcher executable utilized in the installation process of many of these mods (frustratingly) does not always function on multi-monitor setups. If you have more than one monitor, you may need to disable your second while installing the mods, but you can re-enable it once the installation process is complete.

### Single Install

It is critical to ensure that you only have **ONE** installation of KOTOR on your device before beginning the installation process. If you have multiple installations, or even just two game executables in different locations, mod installers which are set up to auto-detect your game's installation directory *will* misidentify which one is correct and install the mods wherever they please, probably spiking your whole install in the process. If you want to make a backup of your vanilla gamestate, make sure to compress the entire game into an archive (.rar, .zip, .7z, etc.) before starting the install process.

### Known Bugs

* For some users, the game may very rarely crash on load when trying to enter a new area due to a data overflow. This is extremeley uncommon and most users should never encounter it, but it is impossible to fully prevent. Fortunately, it is easy to fix if it does happen: simply temporarily disable the 'Frame Buffer Effects' and "Soft Shadows" settings in your advanced graphics options, proceed through the load screen, then re-enable the settings once on the other side. Again, most players should never encounter this.

### Updating from a Prior Build

If you currently have a prior mod build version installed and would like to update to the current Revision, due to the importance of install order to the mod builds' function, there is unfortunately no way to do so without resetting to a fresh install and reinstalling the new build iteration on top. To do this, just perform the zeroing step listed above: uninstall your game, delete all remaining contents in the game directory (remember, frequently, especially on the Steam release of the game, mod content *will not* be uninstalled as part of the application's uninstallation), and then reinstall the game before applying the new build version.

### AMD Players

Not long ago many AMD cards experienced extreme and frequent crashing when playing KOTOR. Recent driver updates have fixed this, so if you get into the game and start experiencing random crashes while walking around, the solution should be as simple as updating your drivers. If for whatever reason that doesn't work, you can try reversion instead: the last known stable AMD driver series is [here](https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/release-notes/rn-rad-win-22-5-1), but bear in mind that, if your AMD hardware is newer than this driver's release date, rolling back will not be possible.

### Mac OS Players

Please see [this link](/modding/mod_builds/macos.html) for installation assistance for the game and these mods.

### Amazon Games Players

For unknown reasons, the Amazon Games version of KOTOR has a modified executable and initiation file which breaks the Miles sound system, and automatically disables both movies and sound. Follow the steps [here](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2377-amazon-gamess-k1-release-soundsmovies-fix/) to restore these features. It's okay to do this now even if you intend to patch widescreen in later, just bear in mind when you do move to patch in widescreen that you already have the editable executable downloaded.

### Linux Players

Please note, case-sensitivity is an issue with many Linux systems (as you may expect). For those not running a case-insensitive distro, you will need to batch-lowercase any mod files--*any* mod files, not just the files that end up in your override directory. It's likely you will need to both lowercase the files before installing any installer-based mod and then again at the end of the process as a batch action in your game directory and all subfolders, as the TSLPatcher/HoloPatcher will generate several files as part of their install processes which will have capitals that are misread.

Most Linux players appear to be using Proton these days, and for those that do there are some known issues with it, both related to crashes with certain older Proton versions and with rendering issues on newer Proton releases. I don't use Linux and don't feel qualified to try to summarize the issues and fixes here, but just be aware if you run into trouble there are several pins in the [Discord's](https://discord.gg/qw7NhM6EW5) #tech_support channel dealing with Proton and how to resolve both issues (the crashing & rendering problems).

### Total Filesize on Disk

For your reference, the total filesize of all mods before extraction, excluding movies, is approximately 7GB. The total size of the install when extracted, including basegame files but excluding upscaled movies, is approximately 14GB. The total install size plus HD movies (Pops Maellard's set) in 1920x1080 resolution is approximately 25GB. Please bear this in mind if you intend to keep backups and/or are operating on a system with limited available memory.

## Optional Install Assistant - Quicker TSLPatching

Because of the way KOTOR mods install, it's virtually impossible to have a true mod manager/installer hybrid like those you may be familiar with for other games, like MO2 or FOMM. The best we can really get are tools to accelerate installations, of which one is supported for the mod builds.

### Quicker TSLPatching

[**Quicker TSLPatching**](https://www.nexusmods.com/kotor/mods/1214?tab=description) is a system workaround (specifically a registry edit) which makes it easier to install mods. This script *will not work* on Mac operating systems (neither Linux, I believe) not running Windows on a partition, but there are some comments in the Posts section of the download page that might offer alternatives that allow it to function properly.

This mod features no level of automation, and only serves to speed up the install process of mods installed via the TSLPatcher executable. Mods will frequently use the TSLPatcher to install, and the TSLPatcher often requires you to manually point the installer at your game's base installation directory. Sometimes the patchers do this automatically, but sometimes they fail, which is where this script comes in; it'll create a symlink to your KOTOR and KOTOR 2 install directories direct to your desktop, where the TSLPatcher defaults to pointing, so you only need to scroll down and click the folder to install without navigating through your system's file structure to find the game folder. The script is confirmed safe and once your install is complete you can delete the desktop folders with no problems. To install, you only need to run the script and follow the instructions it presents, choosing your KOTOR directory in the first popup window and your KOTOR 2 directory in the second. If the script does not function for you, check the Posts section of the mod download page to see some alternate suggestions for manually forcing the functionality of the script.

## Mod List

### KOTOR Dialogue Fixes

**Name:** [KOTOR Dialogue Fixes](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1313-kotor-dialogue-fixes/)

**Author:** Salk & Kainzorus Prime

**Description:** In addition to fixing several typos, this mod takes the PC's dialogue—which is written in such a way as to make the PC sound constantly shocked, stupid, or needlessly and overtly evil—and replaces it with more moderate and reasonable responses, even for DS choices.

**Category & Tier:** Immersion / 1 - Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** NO

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Installation Instructions:** The choice of which version to use is up to you; I recommend PC Response Moderation, as it makes your character sound less like a giddy little schoolchild following every little dialogue, but if you prefer only bugfixes it is compatible. Just move your chosen dialog.tlk file to the *main game directory* (where the executable is)—in this very specific case, NOT the override.

### Character Startup Changes

**Name:** [Character Startup Changes](http://deadlystream.com/files/file/349-character-start-up-change/) and [**Patch**](https://mega.nz/file/sRw1GBIK#J8znLBwR6t7ZvZnpQbsUBYcUNfPCWA7wYNW3qU6gZSg)

**Author:** jonathan7, patch by A Future Pilot

**Description:** In a normal KOTOR start, your character's feats are pre-selected. This mod changes the initial level-up so that the number of feat points given is determined by class, but you can choose the feats you wish to invest into.

**Category & Tier:** Mechanics Change / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** TSLPatcher, Loose-File Patch

**Usage Warning:** It's possible, if using auto level-up, to miss the feats to equip weapons and basic light armor while using this mod, unless you use the patch. Make sure to install it!

___

### Thematic KOTOR Companions

**Name:** [Thematic KOTOR Companions](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2665-thematic-kotor-companions/)

**Author:** Sniggles & JCarter426

**Description:** BioWare did a few wacky things with character progression in this game. To an extent that's novel, since it helps make companions feel more unique and less rigidly tied to the D&D system if they can be stronger than what the system otherwise allows. But it becomes less novel when you realize that most of what they did is just make Jedi companions super OP and short most other party members on stats & feats they should have had.

As part of the Thematic series of mods by JC and myself, Thematic KOTOR Companions is a rework of companion starting attributes, skills, feats and powers to lock all companions into having the exact amount of bonuses they should for their level, as well as retuning several of their setups to more closely match the characters' behaviors and backstories. The goal is to ensure that companions' statlines are not only thematically consistent, but also broadly mechanically balanced, to better-incentivize the use of under-utilized party members.

**Category & Tier:** Mechanics Change / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** TSLPatcher

___

### JC's Minor Fixes

**Name:** [JC's Minor Fixes](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1333-jcs-minor-fixes-for-k1/)

**Author:** JCarter426

**Description:** KOTOR, like with any game, has a slew of little oversights, or things BioWare messed up by accident. The goal of this mod is to fix most of those small things not addressed in other, larger mods.

**Category & Tier:** Bugfix & Graphics Improvement / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Installation Instructions:** Move everything from the Straight Fixes, Resolution Fixes, and Aesthetic Improvements folders to your Override. Move everything from the "Things what bother me" folder as well, EXCEPT the files for the Sith uniform changes: N_AdmrlSaulKar.mdl, N_AdmrlSaulKar.mdx, N_SithComF.mdl, N_SithComF.mdx, N_SithComM.mdl, and N_SithComM.mdx (in other words, move all "MAN26" files and the two "plc_kiosk" files at the bottom). The fix in the Bugfix folder will be applied by a later mod, so you can also skip it.

___

### Ajunta Pall Appearance

**Name:** [Ajunta Pall Unique Appearance](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/824-ajunta-pall-unique-appearance/) and [**Patch**](https://mega.nz/file/McJF1AIC#Jywhu6zXWCRz4gRghxMxoBAWrbU_A3giD1INsOoHqmA)

**Author:** Silveredge9, Patch by A Future Pilot

**Description:** This mod reskins Ajunta Pall to have a unique appearance that matches the honorary statue in the tomb.

**Category & Tier:** Appearance Change & Graphics Improvement / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod, TSLPatcher Patch

**Installation Instructions:** For this specific mod *only*, the patch is actually run first! Run the patch and apply its changes, then open the main mod file. ONLY look at the Transparent/Non-Transparent folders within the main file; move your preferred textures from one of those folders to your override, and optionally **also** move the contents of the sub-folders for Sith eyes if desired. You will be prompted to overwrite, and this is normal. Do NOT move any of the files in the main mod folder! Your install is done once you've moved your desired textures from the main mod download.

### KOTOR Community Patch

**Name:** [KOTOR Community Patch](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1258-kotor-1-community-patch/) and [**Patch**](https://mega.nz/file/gQZR1TZY#U7XN5teK9wjXC5Hnj7MFlmHYb8UFyaV5R17ksIuj7Jc)

**Author:** Various Authors; Darth Parametric, JCarter426 & A Future Pilot Collate

**Description:** An ambitious compilation intending to be a comprehensive bugfix mod for the original game, the KOTOR Community Patch combines hundreds of various fixes and improvements from over a dozen other mods, as well as fixes put together by AFP, DP and JC on their own. With bugfixes as important to KOTOR as TSLRCM's are to KOTOR 2, I can't recommend its use highly enough.

**Category & Tier:** Bugfix, Graphics Improvement & Immersion / 1 - Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** YES for Russian and French only, follow the instructions on the mod page to use

**Installation Method:** HoloPatcher Mod, Loose-File Patch

**Installation Instructions:** Be aware that this mod is one of the very few in the builds that is installed via the HoloPatcher, a new install method. For your purposes as the enduser, it functions almost identically to the TSLPatcher. Run the installer, then move the files from the patch to your override.

___

**Author:** Ashton Scorpius

**Description:** Several alien species in the original game use recycled VO primarily utilized by other species, but KOTOR 2 gives these aliens unique voiceovers instead. This mod uses alien VO ported from KOTOR 2 to give these species their unique VO in the original game as well.

**Category & Tier:** Immersion / 3 - Suggested

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

We aren't going to use all of the HD content she makes—with one exception, I've been careful to only select those I think fit closely with the original design, as well as making enough clear improvements that any aesthetic alterations are acceptable trade-offs for the improved texture quality.

**Author:** DarthParametric

**Description:** In vanilla, female Twi'lek's thigh-high boots are painted on the character's texture rather than added to their equipped clothing as an item, which would give them realistic three-dimensional depth and higher resolution. This modder's resource serves to add the boots as an equipped object.

**Description:** Recolors Calo Nord's clothing to be more muted in tone; you wouldn't expect a famous bounty hunter to run around in bright colors, would you? Note that this does not allow you to play as Calo, nor does it add the custom blaster skin or republic uniform skin seen in the screenshots.

### CineMalak

**Name:** [CineMalak - HD Darth Malak](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2787-cinemalak-hd-malak-retexture/)

**Author:** PoopaPoppaPalpatine

**Description:** Built off of Dark Hope's texture above, CineMalak is a redesign which the author contextualizes as making the clothing look more like a real-world movie costume. I don't think this is an invalid description, but I would rather contextualize it as just making the costume look realistic *full stop*. Malak's outfit, even in Dark Hope's interpretation, doesn't look like real clothing. This mod does a wonderful job of giving his suit the little things - more realistic cloth textures, stitch lines, armor clasps - that make it both HD *and* believable as real clothing.

**Author:** JCarter426

**Description:** If you preferred the robes in KOTOR 2, as most seem to, does JC have a mod for you. Cloaked Jedi Robes migrates all of the robe types from KOTOR 2 straight into KOTOR, while still managing to retain the unique color schemes of the original (should you choose to use one of the two options for that, anyway!). If you've long sought robe consistency across the two games, look no further.

### JC's Jedi Tailor

**Author:** JCarter426

**Description:** It's very annoying when you've got your party together and you want to show your swag off with color-coordinated outfits, but the game only gives you gaudy blue robes. Worry no longer! JC has given us a solution in the form of a skilled Trandoshan tailor, who will dye your robes on demand—it's also compatible with Cloaked Jedi Robes!

And do note, even if you as the player don't intend to ever use stun batons, NPCs frequently do, and this mod is high-quality enough to make that visual difference clear.

### Unique Sith Governor

**Name:** [Unique Sith Governor](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2302-unique-sith-governor/)

**Author:** N-DReW25

**Description:** This is a mod I specifically requested because, by default, the Sith Governor on Taris uses the same model and texture as many other Sith in the game, and looks very similar to Malak's apprentice, Bandon. I felt that visually differentiating them a bit would make Bandon seem more unique by comparison, and thus this mod.

That particular image shows the base Quarren in the game; the "dense" Quarren model from the K1CP, without Dark Hope's texture; and the "dense" model with the new texture.

**Author:** Thor110

**Description:** The wall-mounted trophies in Davik's estate were based off of basegame creature textures, but did not actually use those texture files: they used a downscaled visual of the vanilla texture for the creatures, which made them look even worse than the vanilla creatures, and especially bad compared to upscaled vanilla creature textures. This mod lets them use the full size of the vanilla texture to map, which makes them look less glaringly low-resolution by comparison.

### Sith Uniform Reformation Revised

**Name:** [Sith Uniform Reformation Revised](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2808-heyoranges-sith-uniform-reformation-revised/)

**Author:** Heyorange, Sith Holocron, JCarter426

**Description:** If you ever want a window into incredibly minor things that I think are really cool, this is the cream of the crop. Vanilla KOTOR doesn't really have much rhyme or reason behind differentiating the appearance of the Sith soldiers you encounter, except for rule of cool. This mod makes the clothing of each rank clear and consistent, with an established breakdown of epaulettes, as well as rank and regiment insignias. New, and thanks to Sith Holocron, these textures have also been further enhanced and upscaled to match the rest of the vanilla game's upscales present in the mod builds.

**Category & Tier:** Appearance Change & Graphics Improvement / 2 - Recommended

### Stylized Portraits

**Name:** [Stylized Portraits by Tinman888](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1929-stylized-portraits-by-tinman888/)

**Author:** /u/Tinman888

**Description:** Presented as an alternative to the other HD companion portrait mods previously listed, as well as those companion pictures modified by some of the above graphics mods. If you prefer a more stylized look to your party selection wheel, this lovely mod is the pick for you. Bear in mind that the Revan portrait is optional, so you can exclude that if you would prefer to keep the PC's portraits vanilla.

**Description:** Dark Hope gave Kebla herself a makeover earlier, now it's Drew's turn to give her shop a tidying-up. Compared to Janice's shop on the other side of the city, Kebla's store is in quite a bad state, with junk lying about haphazardly and Kebla working from behind a low desk rather than the store counter in the back. This mod makes Kebla's store more orderly, and has Kebla behind the counter as she likely should've been.

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Download Instructions:** Download the version of the mod you would like based upon how detailed you want the cockpit skyboxes to appear. Keep in mind that load time into the Ebon Hawk could be significantly increased if using very large cockpit textures, and there's also a risk of save corruption when using very large texture sizes—I recommend the Medium texture option for the best balance of quality and size/performance.

___

### Yavin Station Hangar

**Name:** [Yavin Station Hangar](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2068-yavin-station-hangar/)

**Author:** WildKarrde

**Description:** By default when landing on Yavin you leave the *Ebon Hawk* and are placed directly into a hallway, but in the intro movie for Yavin you can see the *Ebon Hawk* landing in a hangar that looks... well, remarkably similar to the Manaan hangar. This mod by WildKarrde brings that hangar to life and integrates it into the station geometry, so you can properly exit the ship and cycle through the airlocks onto the station.

**Category & Tier:** Immersion / 4 - Optional

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** TSLPatcher & Loose-File Mod with **SITUATIONAL** Patch (see Installation Instructions!)

**Installation Instructions:** If you would like the forcefield for the hangar to be visible, re-run the installer after installing the main option and also install the visible forcefield option. If using HQ Cockpit Skyboxes, move the files from the resolution folder corresponding to the HQ Cockpit Skyboxes size you utilized to your override, then delete ebo_yab.tga, ebo_yaf.tga, ebo_yal.tga, ebo_yar.tga and ebo_yat.tga from your override. Finally, if you utilize Vurt's "K1 Hi-Res Ebon Hawk Retexture," download [this patch](https://mega.nz/file/QAhhFTzD#rxS91pehFgNP7xFh3DNnNFC1d_YelF43K4-q6mh8xfI) and move its contents to your override.

**Name:** [Revamped FX](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2581-revamped-fx/)

**Author:** olegkuz1997

**Description:** Rather than a supplementary, this mod by olegkuz should be treated as an alternative to HD Fire and Ice & Hi-Res Beam Effects, already listed above. While this mod edits some files they don't touch and vice-versa, for the most part it replaces those textures. If you would like, you can install this mod and simply not overwrite when prompted to keep most of the changes of Fire and Ice HD & Hi-Res Beam Effects while only adding the files from this mod that those mods don't touch, but if you choose to overwrite this mod will be your main graphical edit for FX.

### Reflective Lightsaber Blades

**Name:** [New Lightsaber Blade Models](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1846-new_lightsaber_blade_model_k1/)

**Author:** Crazy34

**Description:** With this mod, Crazy34 walked into the community, slammed down one of the most impressive mods ever made for this game, and dared us to do better. Not only have they split the blade texture in two to allow for lightsabers with cores of a different color (currently unsupported in the build release, but hopefully coming soon), they've also added *dynamic reflections* to each and every lightsaber across every area of the game. When you're fighting a Dark Jedi, you're going to see your faces bathed in shifting colors, fading and brightening as you swing your lightsabers; when you ignite your saber in a hallway, it will reflect on the floor and walls, and will realistically increase in intensity as the blade draws nearer to the surface. This is an incredible project, and easily one of the most important—and impressive—mods ever released for KOTOR. In the next few years, it could completely change the face of lightsaber modding.

**Description:** The second option of this mod, the Senni Vek Restoration, restores the initial character who leads you to the Geno'Haradan as one of Hulas's henchmen for the showdown on Tatooine, and is fully vanilla-friendly. The default install, Senni Vek's Ambush, removes Hulas from the final confrontation entirely and replaces him with Senni Vek, featuring altered dialogue which implies that Hulas played you for the entire game and has vanished into the shadows to consolidate his control of the Geno'Haradan.

**Description:** Most of the Twi'lek textures used in the game are very samey, ultimately boiling down to just a few alternate textures. This mod makes use of alternate textures created as a modder's resource to significantly differentiate the appearances of many unique Twi'lek NPCs.

**Description:** Originally, swoop bikes in KOTOR were intended to have upgrades available for purchase which would modify their performance. This mod restores two upgrades to the game: one that reduces the speed loss taken when hitting an obstacle, and one which increases acceleration. Right now this mod isn't a perfect implementation of what I'd like, including too few upgrades which are a bit pricey relative to the benefit they give, but I still think it's better for players to have the option to use them than not.

**Author:** Emperor Devon

**Description:** Sometimes you can really feel the disdain for the 11 year olds who were going to play this game in BioWare's writing. "I want to be a Jedi Guardian!" resonates with the soul-crushing hollowness which my mother must have felt when I was 10 and begged for a gameboy.

Anyway, this mod makes the whole Jedi sequence more meaningful by getting rid of the childish response and replacing it with a much more nuanced, alignment-based series of replies.

### Turret Minigame Remover

**Name:** [Random Turret Minigame Remover](https://www.nexusmods.com/kotor/mods/90)

**Author:** KittyKitty

**Description:** It's annoying at best to have to worry about potentially fighting Sith fighters before every hyperspace jump, especially when the fighting isn't particularly difficult and you don't gain anything for winning. This mod removes all such sequences, only leaving the scripted fighter engagements in place.

### Tutorial Remover

**Name:** [Trask Without Tutorials](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2184-trask-ulgo-without-tutorials/)

**Author:** Leilukin

**Description:** If you're on your second playthrough, Trask, his annoying pauses to explain things you already know, and all the "press the A button!" dialogue doesn't just take you out of the experience, it's infuriating. This mod leaves Trask in with all of his usual actions in the prologue, but removes all of his explanatory dialogue about how the game works.

### Leviathan Prison Break

**Name:** [All Hands on Deck for the Leviathan Prison Break](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2097-all-hands-on-deck-for-the-leviathan-prison-break/)

**Author:** Darth Parametric

**Description:** There are a lot of weird inconsistencies with the Leviathan prison break sequence in vanilla, like a LOT. It's easier for you to just read Parametric's notes about what this mod does on the download page than for me to explain it, but in brief it is a consistency and immersion patch.

**Name:** [Party Conversations on the Ebon Hawk](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2284-party-conversations-on-ebon-hawk/)

**Author:** WildKarrde

**Description:** There are many companion dialogues that, in vanilla, can only happen if you bring both the relevant companions to the overworld and run around with them for a bit. In this mod, Wildkarrde borrows a bit from how KOTOR 2 handles companion interactions by allowing many of these dialogues to occur on the Ebon Hawk, so players won't miss them.

### Dark Sacrifice

**Name:** [JC's Romance Enhancement: Dark Sacrifice](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2225-jcs-romance-enhancement-dark-sacrifice-for-k1/)

**Author:** JCarter426

**Description:** As you know, with some small variations KOTOR has a binary ending: Light Side or Dark Side. But it wasn't always so—until quite late in development a very unique ending for Dark Side players who romanced Carth was still being developed, and voice lines were even recorded for it. For unknown reasons this ending was cut, but with this mod it has now been restored. You are not locked into this alternate ending, it's only presented as an option which your character may choose. More than this can't be revealed without giving the ending away, but do note that unless you intend to play as a DS character capable of romancing Carth, this mod will not present any changes. Please also note, a third-party mod by Leilukin not present in this guide makes Carth able to be romanced by male characters, and is compatible with this mod.

**Author:** uwadmin12

**Description:** By default, the "Throw Lightsaber" power is a little weak. Not only does it seem like it takes forever, it does much less damage in a much smaller AoE than powers like Lightning—or even Wave! The goal of this mod is giving Advanced Throw Lightsaber some additional functionality that makes using it worthwhile, namely the inclusion of a knockdown effect on the primary target if that target fails to pass a saving throw. This can make the ability useful for screening particular zones while also dealing damage—still somewhat less effective than Wave, but with more guaranteed damage.

**Name:** [PC Dialogue with Davik's Slave Change](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2214-pc-dialogue-with-daviks-slaves-change/)

**Author:** Leilukin

**Description:** 2003 was a different time, but this mod *really* proves that. In vanilla, if you request a 'massage' from some slaves—which has some sexual implications in Star Wars—you get nothing more than a disgusted remark from some companions. You can even threaten them without consequence. This mod properly amends this, giving you two options: for those deeply bothered by the ability to take advantage of the slaves the option to pressure them into servicing you can be removed entirely, whereas the second retains the massage, but gives Dark Side points for requesting it, as well as adding DS points for threatening the slaves at any point.

**Description:** In all BioWare's infinite brilliance, when they ported KOTOR to PC they didn't just cap the menus to 800x600, they also broke security spikes so they're literally unusable. This mod can't fix that, but it *can* give you a workaround: either some hacky functionality that works just like spikes do, or cold, hard cash in the places where spikes would normally drop.

**Name:** [A Crashed Republic Cruiser on a Nameless World](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1878-a-crashed-republic-cruiser-on-a-nameless-world/)

**Author:** LDR

**Description:** It's difficult for me to talk about this mod without gushing about it. In my opinion, this mod is the *best* piece of added quest content ever made for either KOTOR or KOTOR 2: best-written, best-structured, best-balanced, best-voiced, and most sensible. It brings the player's past into the equation without mandating anything about their nature, and provides a real and immersive look at what your character's past was, and future could be, all while being lore-friendly to **BOTH** KOTOR 2 and The Old Republic. The only reason this mod isn't marked as Essential is because it reuses one module in a way which doesn't allow for suspension of disbelief—everything else about this mod is perfect.

**Description:** No matter how you slice it, Sentinel kind of sucks in KOTOR. It's a game where skills don't matter much, and in those rare instances where you do need them your party can always cover for you. It has a niche, but it's a niche that's useless. This mod endeavors to change that by giving Sentinels sneak attack die every 4 levels, which can even be gained on top of existing sneak attack die from the player's base class. This gives Sentinels more than just an out-of-combat niche to operate in.

**Description:** Sherruk, the Mandalorian leader on Dantooine, likes to collect the lightsabers of the Jedi whom he's killed, and the settlers on the plains tell you that he's been heard to use them in battle.

**Description:** As much as I'd like to think that Malak is just too lazy to care, it's unlikely he'd let Bastila run around with the same pseudo-robes she used as a Jedi without marking her as subservient to the Dark Side.

**Description:** By default, the forcefield in the Kashyyyk shadowlands doesn't have any point of interaction to it, and so to get around this oversight BioWare had to use some camera trickery to prevent the player from seeing what Jolee was doing.

**Author:** JCarter426

**Description:** Makes Mandalorian armor consistent throughout the game, and ensures that all models use the colored ranking system present in KOTOR.

**Category & Tier:** Appearance Change & Immersion / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Multi-Run TSLPatcher

**Installation Instructions:** Install Option A. I recommend NOT re-running the patcher to install the extra textures, as upscaled textures installed in UCO are much higher-quality than these.

### Multifire & Autofire

**Name:** [Multifire and Autofire and Finesse](https://www.nexusmods.com/kotor/mods/1711)

**Author:** darthbdaman

**Description:** This is a meaty mod that makes a lot of changes, and I strongly recommend reading the mod description in detail, but here is a brief synopsis: in KOTOR, repeating rifles (think machine guns) were supposed to be able to make multiple attacks per turn, but this was cut. This mod adds multifire (+1 attack per round) to all *rifles*, and autofire (+2 attacks per round) to *repeaters*, along with an attack (chance-to-hit) penalty to both weapon types, of -4 and -6 respectively. There are two important caveats to this: the rifles change was not something that was originally intended by BioWare (but which I don't find terribly unbalanced, because it helps enemies too); and the multifire and autofire *are not toggles*, they are always on for those weapon types. The mod does have several install options which do not add the multifire to rifles, however, if you don't want the change which BioWare did not intend.

If you would prefer a pure damage increase to resolve the discrepancy in repeating rifle price/rarity rather than this multifire option, you can skip this mod and install JC's Blaster Adjustment below. JC's Blaster Adjustment can also be used in conjunction with any install option of Multifire and Autofire.

**Category & Tier:** Mechanics Change / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES, though some text may be blank or in English

**Installation Method:** HoloPatcher

**Installation Instructions:** Run the patcher and select your desired install. I personally would recommend using at least one of the first three, as the mod is not worth it for just the feat changes in my opinion. My personal recommendation would be option 2 or 3 (especially if intending to use JC's Blaster Adjustment below), but I tested it with option 1 and did not find it terribly overpowered. Indeed, it made the game way harder at points as enemies were beaming me with multiple rifle attacks, so if you want an extra challenge option 1 is a valid choice.

### Blaster Adjustment

**Name:** [JC's Blaster Adjustment](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2827-jcs-blaster-adjustment-for-k1/)

**Author:** JCarter426

**Description:** Although this mod was made as a standalone option to resolve multiple problems with blasters - low blaster base damage, minimal crit chance variety, and weaker repeaters than BioWare intended - it can also be used in conjunction with bdaman's mod above. Long story short, JC's mod takes KOTOR's blasters and (for the most part) gives them the stats of KOTOR 2's blasters, including their more varied critical chances and bonus damage. This takes a weapon type which is extremely limited in its potential in the original game and leaves them viable for players.

**Category & Tier:** Mechanics Change / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** TSLPatcher

**Installation Instructions:** If you installed the main option of Multifire and Autofire, I recommend using the *Blaster Pistol + Critical* option of this mod, as applying its changes to repeaters and rifles would make them insanely overpowered with their auto-attacks. If using Options 2 or 3 of Multifire and Autofire, I would recommend the *Blaster Pistol & Blaster Rifle + Critical* version of this mod--don't worry, it won't make rifles way stronger; JC's changes to the damage will overwrite bdaman's, in effect just adding JC's alterations to the critical strike ranges. Finally, if not using bdaman's mod, I recommend the full install.

**Author:** offthegridmorty

**Description:** If you intend on modding both games, you'd better start getting ready to put some respect on morty's name. For the past two years he had been belting out banger mods one after the other, and this is no exception. Logically, your repair skill represents your familiarity with machines, and the more you understand something, the easier it should be to break it, right? This mod scales the damage from the Stun Droid power line with your repair, making it more viable while also rewarding the player for skills investment.

### Alignment Affects Force Powers

**Name:** [Alignment Affects Force Powers](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2759-alignment-affects-force-powers-k1/)

**Author:** offthegridmorty

**Description:** Okay, the last one was cool—this one is *badass*. Why is it that, if you've fallen to the absolute depth of the Dark Side, you can throw lightning no more powerful than when you were first beginning to fall? Why is it that, as a paragon of the Light, the strength of your connections changes nothing about the power of the Force you can use to defend yourself? Well, now it does. Be an enlightened Jedi with mighty buffs that last an extended duration, or a fierce Sith Lord whose lightnings are easy to cast and mercilessly damaging. But better still, this mod isn't about a power fantasy—there are consequences that come from aligning strongly with one side, leading to atrophied abilities from the other extreme. It's a well-thought-out design that is well-balanced and feels great ingame while also being logically consistent. In my view, that makes this mod a must-have.

**Category & Tier:** Mechanics Change & Immersion / 1 - Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** YES, though some text may be blank or in English

### Remove Duplicate TGA/TPC

**Name:** [Remove Duplicate TGA/TPC](https://www.nexusmods.com/kotor/mods/1384) OR [Bash script for MacOS/Linux](https://pastebin.com/6WCN122S)

**Author:** Flachzangen, bash version by /u/th3w1zard1

**Description:** This is a script written by Flachzangen which allows you to remove duplicate .TGA or .TPC files in your game directory. Files with the .TPC filetype take priority, so for several of the patches we've downloaded which are of the .tga filetype, we need to delete any .TPC duplicates in order to get them to read properly. That's what this script will do. It is **CRITICAL** to use this script, as, if .tpc files take priority in some instances, the game will crash.

**Category & Tier:** Patch / 1 - Essential

**Installation Method:** .bat Patcher

**Installation Instructions:** Place DelDuplicateTGA-TPC (or the bash script version) in your main game folder (NOT override!), run it, **say that TPC should be deleted** and do not manually confirm. If you are on a Mac or other device that cannot run .bat files and the bash script is not an option for you to use, a list of all the files you will need to manually delete can be found [here](/modding/mod_builds/k1/delete.html).

**MAKE SURE THIS SCRIPT RUNS PROPERLY!** On some operating systems, overzealous antivirus setups, or filepaths with particular characters in them it may fail. If the file outputs "Finished, Press any key to continue" but does not list any files it deleted, it *is not working*, and if it does not work it *will* crash your game. You can try to resolve this by moving your Override folder to a different location (I recommend a subfolder in your Documents or Downloads directories), putting the .bat file there and running it through that directory, but if that doesn't work you will need to manually go through and delete the duplicates from the link above.

**Author:** ShiningRedHD

**Description:** This is the point at which we're going to install all the various patches produced for the Ultimate Character Overhaul for any of the other texture mods which you've installed.

**Category & Tier:** Patch & Graphics Improvement / 1 - Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Masters:** Ultimate Character Overhaul & Various Texture Mods

**Download Instructions:** Skip the compatch for Better Twi'lek Male Heads if you chose to use Leilukin's Male Twi'lek NPC Diversity.

**Installation Instructions:** Scroll down to the "optional files" section of the mod page. In order, install the compatch for JC's Minor Fixes, the K1CP (delete "PLC_SSldCrps.tpc". Additionally delete N_CommM01 - 06, plus N_CommM08, if using Dark Hope's male clothing upscale. Only then move the files to your override), and then all remaining content that matches content you chose to use from the builds (again, skipping Better Twi'lek Male Heads, if using Leilukin's mod). I also recommend against using the patch for JC's Mandalorian Armor, as there are better options (in my opinion) in Character Textures & Model Fixes below. If using Thigh-High Boots for Twi'lek, only move the patch content from the NPC Replacement folder. If using Republic Soldier's New Shade, use the New Shade option.

### Character Textures & Model Fixes

**Name:** [Character Textures & Model Fixes](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2659-4x-upscale-character-textures-model-fixes/)

**Author:** Redrob41

**Description:** Redrob is a quiet legend within the scene, who disappears for years and pops back up with projects nobody expects but which become instant classics. Welcome to the latest. This mod is an upscale of virtually all NPC textures in the game, including aliens and some creatures. But that's not all—Rob is skilled with texture work, and although this package uses AI as a base, he's gone over it by hand and corrected, adjusted, and in some cases entirely retextured parts of the textures to eliminate hallucinations, burring or fuzziness, and preserve the original aesthetic of the texture. What's more, Rob's forte is modeling, and he's included a huge series of model adjustments and fixes along with this package which fixes various rendering issues. I can't recommend this package highly enough.

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 1 - Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File (with optional automation)

**Download Instructions:** *Strongly* recommend the 2x .tpc version; the fidelity loss for 2x is minimal, .tpc is a lossless conversion and is much slimmer in filesize, and the automated compatibility program for this mod relies on the filetype being .tpc to function.

**Installation Instructions:** If you are on a system which can run .bat files, I *strongly* recommend using the automated system to deal with compatibility for this mod. To do so, first extract redrob's mod from its archive, then go to [this page](https://github.com/KOTOR-Community-Portal/mod-builds/blob/dev/scripts/cleaner.bat) and click on the button with the arrow pointing down at the top of the code list (the one which says "download raw file"). Place cleaner.bat in the folder from redrob's mod called "Copy contents to KotOR's Override folder", then go to [here](https://github.com/KOTOR-Community-Portal/mod-builds/blob/dev/scripts/cleanlist_k1.txt) and repeat the same step, placing cleanlist_k1.txt in the same location. You can now run cleanlist.bat: follow the instructions onscreen, selecting whether you did or didn't use any of the given mods, and the batch file will automatically delete the incompatible files. Once you reach the end of the list, you can exit the .bat window, delete cleaner.bat and cleanlist_k1.txt, and then move the remaining files in the folder to your override.

If you cannot run .bat files or feel uncomfortable running this file, you will need to manually delete the files yourself, following the instructions [here](https://github.com/KOTOR-Community-Portal/mod-builds/blob/dev/content/k1/redrob_deletions.md).

### 4GB Patcher

**Name:** [4GB Patcher](https://ntcore.com/?page_id=371)

**Author:** Daniel Pistelli

**Description:** This is a program which modifies your game's executable file to be able to utilize up to 4 gigabytes of RAM, since KOTOR is a 32-bit application and by default can only utilize 2 gigabytes. This will help the game run smoothly even with the larger texture throughput this build creates, and also reduces issues caused by a memory leak which is native to the game, preventing crashes and savegame corruption.

**Category & Tier:** Patch / 1 - Essential

**Installation Method:** Executable

**Installation Instructions:** If you intend to add widescreen support, *proceed to the below section and* **FULLY** *apply your chosen widescreen resolution* **AND** *all additional widescreen support mods you choose to use* **BEFORE** *completing this step*. Once you are done applying all your chosen widescreen content, you are then free to apply this patch.

Additionally, **DO NOT** apply this step with the Steam version of the game, unless you have applied the below widescreen patch! Without the modified widescreen .exe, Steam's executable copy is encrypted in such a way that executing this patcher will break it and prevent the game from launching. Although it's unfortunate to not have access to the patch, it doesn't introduce any fatal errors or shortcomings if you are on Steam and choose not to apply widescreen so it can be used; I recommend just being sure to exit your game and restart the application from the top once every four hours or so!

## Optional Widescreen & Extended Widescreen Support Mods

If you want support for widescreen resolutions above 1280x1024, it's highly recommended that you follow the instructions presented in the following video. By using UniWS, you also avoid many of the issues caused by FlawlessWidescreen, including savegame corruption:

[KOTOR Widescreen Patch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSizFARnwyM)

Although the video says otherwise, on some operating systems setting your display scale to 100% can be avoided by right-clicking the application, going to compatibility, selecting Change High DPI Settings, and setting the override to be scaled by the application. If your OS does not allow this function, you *will* need desktop scaling set at 100%.

Also note that, upon application of widescreen, *you will need to launch the game directly from the executable from that point on*. This means, for instance, not launching the game through the Steam interface. This is due to the edits made by widescreen which break the handshake between Steam and the executable.

After you've applied UniWS, you can also install the mods below, which further enhance the game's widescreen implementation significantly:

### Turret Cockpit Widescreen

**Name:** [Turret Cockpit Widescreen](https://www.nexusmods.com/kotor/mods/1211)

### HR Menus

**Name:** [KOTOR High Resolution Menus](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1159-kotor-high-resolution-menus/?tab=comments)

**Author:** ndix UR

**Description:** Edits your game's .exe file to allow the in-game menus to be represented at your game's edited resolution rather than the permanent 800x600 of the default port. This will only work on the GoG, 4-disk, MacOS, and UniWS-patched Steam versions of the game; for it to be effective, the game must *already be patched* to your widescreen resolution of choice (IE, make sure you've applied UniWS first)!

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 1 - Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** .bat Patcher with Loose-File Components

**Installation Instructions:** Make a copy of your swkotor.exe (only AFTER having applied the UniWS widescreen patch) and paste it into the extracted mod folder with the .bat file within. Run the .bat file (NOT the .exe!) and input the necessary data. The .bat will generate a new file called swkotor.exe, as well as swkotor.exe.bak—*swkotor.exe is the correct file*, and the file with .bak appended at the end is a backup which you can safely delete. Take the new swkotor.exe file and replace the one in your main game directory with it, then move the HR Menus files for your selected resolution into your override folder.

### HD UI Menu Pack

**Name:** [HD UI Menu Pack](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1226-hd-ui-menu-pack/)

**Author:** ndix UR

**Description:** While the previous mod allows the in-game menus to display at higher resolutions, it doesn't include the rebuilt icons and UI elements that would make those menus appear functional and sharp at higher resolution. This mod is designed to visually improve all the various menu UI elements so they're clear at the higher resolutions. For all intents, it's a mandatory patch of the above mod.

### Cutscenes Rescaled

**Name:** [K1 Cutscenes Rescaled](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2380-k1-cutscenes-rescaled/)

**Author:** Pops Maellard

**Description:** This mod is a *killer* cutscene improvement mod, using a very clean, very sharp AI pass to upscale and clarify the cutscenes. A movie replacer like this is necessary to fix the fullscreen bug which causes forced game minimization when cutscenes play (plus they're just *really* good), so it's hugely recommended to use it whether you experience issues with fullscreen play or not.

Unfortunately, there's a price for the quality of Pops's work: the files are extremely hefty, coming in at a whopping 15 gigs. This mod is by far the better of the two cutscene mods available, but if you're on limited data, a poor connection or have limited drive space, it's a much better idea to use naelavok's remastered cutscenes below rather than Pops's version here. If you've got the space and the speed, though, this is where it's at.

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 1 - Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Installation Instructions:** Choose the resolution option which most closely fits your monitor's screen size during the download process. I *STRONGLY* recommend choosing the 30fps option for that resolution—there have been crashes directly linked to the 60fps versions. When installing, there will be several optional files based on how dialogue in cutscenes are displayed (floating text or not, etc). Which of these you choose is your preference; use the mod screenshots to determine. Bear in mind that the files from this mod go in your *movies* folder, not override.

If you experience issues with the game minimizing during cutscenes, it might be necessary to go to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA5l6HVs4Y4) and following the instructions to use RAD tools to "upscale" the cutscenes to match your exact resolution, though I have not personally attempted this so I don't know how much time it would take to complete. I would estimate around 8 hours, which is the typical time it takes for the native movies to be scaled to 1920x1080 using the same system, but remember that this would be a fully-automated process.

### Remastered Cutscenes

**Name:** [KOTOR Remastered Cutscenes](https://www.nexusmods.com/kotor/mods/1306)

**Author:** naelavok 

**Description:** Using predictive AI, reddit user naelavok has upscaled the cutscenes for both games out of their horrendous default resolution, to be much more crisp and viewable. This work was done back in 2019, if you can believe it, and is thus much more limited than Pops's version above. Nevertheless it's still a massive improvement over the default cutscenes, and still fixes the fullscreen bug, if you're experiencing it.

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 4 - Optional

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod with Possible Hex Editing Requirements

**Known Bugs:** With this movie pack, the title crawl movie is broken and will not play normally. It can be skipped and does not crash the game, but will not display.

**Installation Instructions:** Use only Pops Maellard's cutscenes or this version by naelavok. To install, choose the resolution option which most closely fits your monitor's screen size during the download process. Bear in mind that the files from this mod go in your *movies* folder, not override.

## Misc. Basegame Issues & Fixes

### Crash After Character Creation

This is a common issue which users tend to think is caused by the mod builds, but 99.9% of the time you don't have a mod error, and this is a basegame issue. Sometimes the game refuses to load when you have the Frame Buffer Effects setting enabled, so just disabling it in your Advanced Graphics Options ingame will allow you to load the game. This can also get you past loadscreen crashes that may rarely occur later in the game.

### Character Stuck After Combat

This isn't a bug that modding can fix (or cause), it's an engine bug. It's related to the game's framerate being unsynced with your monitor's refresh rate. If you're on a 60hz monitor, you can just toggle v-sync. If you're 144hz or similar, just set your monitor to 60hz manually for the duration of play (and also toggle v-sync).

### Grass

If you have issues with objects disappearing behind grass or grass not rendering properly, [this page](http://steamcommunity.com/app/32370/discussions/0/41973821366855313/) purports to have a fix. I have not tested it personally, but users with grass issues report that it fixes the rendering problems—*however*, they also report that it will render many textures partially transparent. Disabling grass in the .ini will also fix rendering issues with grass, and is what I recommend, but this is an option for those who wish to avoid that, to be taken at their own risk.

### Swoop Racing

Although I don't recommend staying in compatibility mode for Windows XP SP3 long-term, as it can exacerbate some crashes on load screens (which can be resolved in turn by disabling Frame Buffer Effects in your .ini, though that's not ideal either), sometimes swoop racing can mess up in a way that makes it necessary. If you find your swoop bike floating several meters off the track, exit the game and launch it in compatibility mode for XP SP3. You should be able to race normally, and you can turn off the compatibility mode after the racing segment is over.
