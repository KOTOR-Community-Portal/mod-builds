# Widescreen Support Mods for KOTOR 1

**Author:** MadDerp

**Name:** [KOTOR High Resolution Menus](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1159-kotor-high-resolution-menus/?tab=comments)

**Author:** ndix UR

**Description:** Edits your game's .exe file to allow the in-game menus to be represented at your game's edited resolution rather than the permanent 800x600 of the default port. This hack will only work on the GoG, 4-disk, iOS, and UniWS-patched Steam versions of the game; for it to be effective, the game must be *pre-patched* to your widescreen resolution of choice!

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 1 - Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** .bat Patcher with Loose-File Components

**Installation Instructions:** Make a copy of your swkotor.exe (only AFTER having applied the UniWS widescreen patch) and paste it into the extracted mod folder with the .bat file within. Run the .bat file (NOT the .exe!) and input the necessary data. The .bat will generate a new file called swkotor.exe, as well as swkotor.exe.bakâ€”*swkotor.exe is the correct file*, and the file with .bak appended at the end is a backup which you can safely delete. Take the new swkotor.exe file and replace the one in your main game directory with it, then move the HR Menus files for your selected resolution into your override folder.

**Name:** [HD UI Menu Pack](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1226-hd-ui-menu-pack/)

**Author:** ndix UR

**Description:** While the previous mod allows the in-game menus to display at higher resolutions, it doesn't include the rebuilt icons and UI elements that would make those menus appear functional and sharp at higher resolution. This mod is designed to visually improve all the various menu UI elements so they're functional and clear at the higher resolutions. For all intents, it's a mandatory patch of the above mod.

**Author:** Darth Parametric

**Description:** A camera tweak for running the game at higher resolutions intended to allow you to examine weapon models with a little bit more detail in the Workbench upgrade screen.

**Name:** [Pretty Good! Icons](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1815-pretty-good-icons-for-kotor/)

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Name:** [Upscaled Computer](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2025-upscaled-computer/)

**Author:** Dark Hope

**Description:** Adds an HD computer interface, really only valuable when playing in widescreen due to menu limitations.

**Name:** [Widescreen Fade Fix](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1792-kotor-widescreen-fade-fix/)

**Author:** Doiinko

**Description:** At modded resolutions, part of the screen fades in at a different speed than the rest of the screen. This simple mod fixes the fade so it's uniform.

**Category & Tier:** Bugfix / 3 - Suggested

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

___

**Name:** [Main Menu Widescreen Fix](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1173-k1-main-menu-widescreen-fix/)

**Author:** DarthParametric

**Description:** Like the turret cockpit, by default the game's main menu isn't intended to be viewed in widescreen. This fix widens the viewing angle of the main menu and moves the smoke effects to the edge of the screen, so the menu appears as it should even in higher resolutions.

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Name:** [KOTOR Remastered Cutscenes](https://www.nexusmods.com/kotor/mods/1306)

**Author:** naelavok 

**Description:** Using predictive AI, /u/naelavok has upscaled the cutscenes for both games out of their horrendous default resolution, to be much more crisp and viewable. A movie replacer like this is necessary to fix the fullscreen bug (plus they're just *really* good), so it's hugely recommended to use it whether you experience issues with fullscreen play or not.

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod with Possible Hex Editing Requirements

**Installation Instructions:** Choose the resolution option which most closely fits your monitor's screen size during the download process. After the files are downloaded and you've replaced the movies in your movies folder, you'll need to hex edit your executable to run them properly; see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA5l6HVs4Y4) for visual instructions on how to do so (you can skip the first part about using RAD tools to upscale the movies). Note that the UniWS widescreen program which you should've already used to apply basic widescreen function *may* automatically edit the necessary hex strings for you, but it won't always; checking to make sure that the hexes for your resolution are the ones set is important to make sure this mod functions!

If you still experience issues with minimizations during cutscenes, it should be possible to return to Xuul's video above and run the RAD tools on the new movies to re-scale them to fit your exact monitor's resolution, though I haven't attempted this so I don't know the amount of time it would take. I would estimate around 8 hours, which is the typical time it takes for the native movies to be scaled to 1920x1080 using the same system, but remember that this would be a fully-automated process.
