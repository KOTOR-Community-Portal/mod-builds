# Widescreen Support Mods for KOTOR 1

**Name:** [Turret Cockpit Widescreen](https://www.nexusmods.com/kotor/mods/1211)

**Author:** MadDerp

**Description:** Fixes visual issues in the turret cockpit caused by widescreen showing angles which were never supposed to be visible.

**Category & Tier:** Bugfix / 3 - Suggested

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Name:** [KOTOR High Resolution Menus](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1159-kotor-high-resolution-menus/?tab=comments)

**Author:** ndix UR

**Description:** Edits your game's .exe file to allow the in-game menus to be represented at your game's edited resolution rather than the permanent 800x600 of the default port. This will only work on the GoG, 4-disk, MacOS, and UniWS-patched Steam versions of the game; for it to be effective, the game must *already be patched* to your widescreen resolution of choice (IE, make sure you've applied UniWS first)!

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 1 - Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** .bat Patcher with Loose-File Components

**Installation Instructions:** Make a copy of your swkotor.exe (only AFTER having applied the UniWS widescreen patch) and paste it into the extracted mod folder with the .bat file within. Run the .bat file (NOT the .exe!) and input the necessary data. The .bat will generate a new file called swkotor.exe, as well as swkotor.exe.bakâ€”*swkotor.exe is the correct file*, and the file with .bak appended at the end is a backup which you can safely delete. Take the new swkotor.exe file and replace the one in your main game directory with it, then move the HR Menus files for your selected resolution into your override folder.

**Name:** [HD UI Menu Pack](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1226-hd-ui-menu-pack/)

**Author:** ndix UR

**Description:** While the previous mod allows the in-game menus to display at higher resolutions, it doesn't include the rebuilt icons and UI elements that would make those menus appear functional and sharp at higher resolution. This mod is designed to visually improve all the various menu UI elements so they're clear at the higher resolutions. For all intents, it's a mandatory patch of the above mod.

**Category & Tier:** Patch / 1 - Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Name:** [HD Robe Icons for JC's Cloaked Jedi Robes](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2303-hd-robe-icons-for-jcs-cloaked-jedis-and-effixs-extra-robes/)

**Author:** Nehua

**Description:** Rather than using icons matching the vanilla robe appearances even when using JC's cloaked Jedi robes, this mod adds icons specifically matching the cloaked robes.

**Category & Tier:** Appearance Change & Graphics Improvement / 3 - Suggested

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Masters:** JC's Cloaked Jedi Robes

**Installation Instructions:** In the "JC's Cloaked Jedis" folder, select the files from the version of JC's Cloaked Jedi Robes you utilized. Ignore the Effix folder unless playing with that specific mod.

**Author:** Dark Hope

**Name:** [Widescreen Fade Fix](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1792-kotor-widescreen-fade-fix/)

**Author:** Doiinko

**Description:** At modded resolutions, part of the screen fades in at a different speed than the rest of the screen. This simple mod fixes the fade so it's uniform.

___

**Name:** [Main Menu Widescreen Fix](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1173-k1-main-menu-widescreen-fix/)

**Author:** DarthParametric

**Description:** Like the turret cockpit, by default the game's main menu isn't intended to be viewed in widescreen. This fix widens the viewing angle of the main menu and moves the smoke effects to the edge of the screen, so the menu appears as it should even in higher resolutions.

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Name:** [K1 Cutscenes Rescaled](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2380-k1-cutscenes-rescaled/)

**Author:** Pops Maellard

**Description:** This mod is a *killer* cutscene improvement mod, using a very clean, very sharp AI pass to upscale and clarify the cutscenes. A movie replacer like this is necessary to fix the fullscreen bug which causes forced game minimization when cutscenes play (plus they're just *really* good), so it's hugely recommended to use it whether you experience issues with fullscreen play or not.

Unfortunately, there's a price for the quality of Pops's work: the files are extremely hefty, coming in at a whopping 15 gigs. This mod is by far the better of the two cutscene mods available, but if you're on limited data, a poor connection or have limited drive space, it's a much better idea to use naelavok's remastered cutscenes below rather than Pops's version here. If you've got the space and the speed, though, this is where it's at.

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 1 - Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Installation Instructions:** Choose the resolution option which most closely fits your monitor's screen size during the download process. I *STRONGLY* recommend choosing the 30fps option for that resolution--there have been crashes directly linked to the 60fps versions. When installing, there will be several optional files based on how dialogue in cutscenes are displayed (floating text or not, etc). Which of these you choose is your preference; use the mod screenshots to determine. Bear in mind that the files from this mod go in your *movies* folder, not override.

If you experience issues with the game minimizing during cutscenes, it might be necessary to go to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA5l6HVs4Y4) and following the instructions to use RAD tools to "upscale" the cutscenes to match your exact resolution, though I have not personally attempted this so I don't know how much time it would take to complete. I would estimate around 8 hours, which is the typical time it takes for the native movies to be scaled to 1920x1080 using the same system, but remember that this would be a fully-automated process.

**Name:** [KOTOR Remastered Cutscenes](https://www.nexusmods.com/kotor/mods/1306)

**Author:** naelavok 

**Description:** Using predictive AI, reddit user naelavok has upscaled the cutscenes for both games out of their horrendous default resolution, to be much more crisp and viewable. This work was done back in 2019, if you can believe it, and is thus much more limited than Pops's version above. Nevertheless it's still a massive improvement over the default cutscenes, and still fixes the fullscreen bug, if you're experiencing it.

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 4 - Optional

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod with Possible Hex Editing Requirements

**Installation Instructions:** Use only Pops Maellard's cutscenes or this version by naelavok. To install, choose the resolution option which most closely fits your monitor's screen size during the download process. Bear in mind that the files from this mod go in your *movies* folder, not override.
