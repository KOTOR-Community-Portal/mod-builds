## Mod List

### KOTOR Dialogue Fixes

**Name:** [KOTOR Dialogue Fixes](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1313-kotor-dialogue-fixes/)

**Author:** Salk & Kainzorus Prime

**Description:** In addition to fixing several typos, this mod takes the PC's dialogue—which is written in such a way as to make the PC sound constantly shocked, stupid, or needlessly and overtly evil—and replaces it with more moderate and reasonable responses, even for DS choices.

**Category & Tier:** Immersion / 1 - Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** NO

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Installation Instructions:** The choice of which version to use is up to you; I recommend PC Response Moderation, as it makes your character sound less like a giddy little schoolchild following every little dialogue, but if you prefer only bugfixes it is compatible. Just move your chosen dialog.tlk file to the *main game directory* (where the executable is)—in this very specific case, NOT the override.

___

### Character Startup Changes

**Name:** [Character Startup Changes](http://deadlystream.com/files/file/349-character-start-up-change/) and [**Patch**](https://mega.nz/file/sRw1GBIK#J8znLBwR6t7ZvZnpQbsUBYcUNfPCWA7wYNW3qU6gZSg)

**Author:** jonathan7, patch by A Future Pilot

**Description:** In a normal KOTOR start, your character's feats are pre-selected. This mod changes the initial level-up so that the number of feat points given is determined by class, but you can choose the feats you wish to invest into.

**Category & Tier:** Mechanics Change / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** TSLPatcher, Loose-File Patch

**Usage Warning:** It's possible, if using auto level-up, to miss the feats to equip weapons and basic light armor while using this mod, unless you use the patch. Make sure to install it!

___

### Thematic KOTOR Companions

**Name:** [Thematic KOTOR Companions](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2665-thematic-kotor-companions/)

**Author:** Sniggles & JCarter426

**Description:** BioWare did a few wacky things with character progression in this game. To an extent that's novel, since it helps make companions feel more unique and less rigidly tied to the D&D system if they can be stronger than what the system otherwise allows. But it becomes less novel when you realize that most of what they did is just make Jedi companions super OP and short most other party members on stats & feats they should have had.

As part of the Thematic series of mods by JC and myself, Thematic KOTOR Companions is a rework of companion starting attributes, skills, feats and powers to lock all companions into having the exact amount of bonuses they should for their level, as well as retuning several of their setups to more closely match the characters' behaviors and backstories. The goal is to ensure that companions' statlines are not only thematically consistent, but also broadly mechanically balanced, to better-incentivize the use of under-utilized party members.

**Category & Tier:** Mechanics Change / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** TSLPatcher

___

### JC's Minor Fixes

**Name:** [JC's Minor Fixes](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1333-jcs-minor-fixes-for-k1/)

**Author:** JCarter426

**Description:** KOTOR, like with any game, has a slew of little oversights, or things BioWare messed up by accident. The goal of this mod is to fix most of those small things not addressed in other, larger mods.

**Category & Tier:** Bugfix & Graphics Improvement / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Installation Instructions:** Move everything from the Straight Fixes, Resolution Fixes, and Aesthetic Improvements folders to your Override. Move everything from the "Things what bother me" folder as well, EXCEPT the files for the Sith uniform changes: N_AdmrlSaulKar.mdl, N_AdmrlSaulKar.mdx, N_SithComF.mdl, N_SithComF.mdx, N_SithComM.mdl, and N_SithComM.mdx (in other words, move all "MAN26" files and the two "plc_kiosk" files at the bottom). The fix in the Bugfix folder will be applied by a later mod, so you can also skip it.

___

### Ajunta Pall Appearance

**Name:** [Ajunta Pall Unique Appearance](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/824-ajunta-pall-unique-appearance/) and [**Patch**](https://mega.nz/file/McJF1AIC#Jywhu6zXWCRz4gRghxMxoBAWrbU_A3giD1INsOoHqmA)

**Author:** Silveredge9, Patch by A Future Pilot

**Description:** This mod reskins Ajunta Pall to have a unique appearance that matches the honorary statue in the tomb.

**Category & Tier:** Appearance Change & Graphics Improvement / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod, TSLPatcher Patch

**Installation Instructions:** For this specific mod *only*, the patch is actually run first! Run the patch and apply its changes, then open the main mod file. ONLY look at the Transparent/Non-Transparent folders within the main file; move your preferred textures from one of those folders to your override, and optionally **also** move the contents of the sub-folders for Sith eyes if desired. You will be prompted to overwrite, and this is normal. Do NOT move any of the files in the main mod folder! Your install is done once you've moved your desired textures from the main mod download.

___

### KOTOR Community Patch

**Name:** [KOTOR Community Patch](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1258-kotor-1-community-patch/) and [**Patch**](https://mega.nz/file/gQZR1TZY#U7XN5teK9wjXC5Hnj7MFlmHYb8UFyaV5R17ksIuj7Jc)

**Author:** Various Authors; Darth Parametric, JCarter426 & A Future Pilot Collate

**Description:** An ambitious compilation intending to be a comprehensive bugfix mod for the original game, the KOTOR Community Patch combines hundreds of various fixes and improvements from over a dozen other mods, as well as fixes put together by AFP, DP and JC on their own. With bugfixes as important to KOTOR as TSLRCM's are to KOTOR 2, I can't recommend its use highly enough.

**Category & Tier:** Bugfix, Graphics Improvement & Immersion / 1 - Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** YES for Russian and French only, follow the instructions on the mod page to use

**Installation Method:** HoloPatcher Mod, Loose-File Patch

**Installation Instructions:** Be aware that this mod is one of the very few in the builds that is installed via the HoloPatcher, a new install method. For your purposes as the enduser, it functions almost identically to the TSLPatcher. Run the installer, then move the files from the patch to your override.

___

### Droid Claw Fix

**Name:** [Droid Claw Fix](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2456-kotor1-droid-claw-fix/)

### Ported VO Replacements

**Name:** [K1 Ported Alien VO Replacements](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1426-k1-ported-alien-vo-replacements/)

**Author:** Ashton Scorpius

**Description:** Several alien species in the original game use recycled VO primarily utilized by other species, but KOTOR 2 gives these aliens unique voiceovers instead. This mod uses alien VO ported from KOTOR 2 to give these species their unique VO in the original game as well.

**Category & Tier:** Immersion / 3 - Suggested

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 1 - Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

### PMHA05 HD

**Name:** [PMHA05 HD](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1857-pmha05-hd/)

**Author:** Dark Hope

**Description:** This is the first in a series of high-resolution player heads from Dark Hope, complete with full Dark Side transitions and new player portraits. We aren't going to use all of the HD content she makes—with one exception, I've been careful to only select those I think fit closely with the original design, as well as making enough clear improvements that any aesthetic alterations are acceptable trade-offs for the improved texture quality.

This specific texture reskins the fifth Asian male head preset, including new facial hair.

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement & Appearance Change / 3 - Suggested

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Name:** [PFHC05 HD](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1738-pfhc05-hd/)

**Author:** Dark Hope

**Description:** This Dark Hope retexture reskins the fifth Caucasian female head preset. Dark Hope took some liberties here, adding a more detailed hair ornament and a tattoo to the side of the player's head, but I really enjoy the changes.

**Author:** Darth Parametric

**Description:** The eye overlays on the second black female head were input incorrectly and become offset as the player transitions to the Dark Side, creating the appearance of duplicated irises. This mod fixes that, as well as offering an upscale option which improves the base appearance of the head.

**Category & Tier:** Bugfix & Graphics Improvement / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Installation Instructions:** I recommend using the upscale option.

**Name:** [Thigh-High Boots for Twi'lek](http://deadlystream.com/files/file/1087-k1-thigh-high-boots-for-female-twilek-body-modders-resource/)

**Author:** DarthParametric

**Description:** In vanilla, female Twi'lek's thigh-high boots are painted on the character's texture rather than added to their equipped clothing as an item, which would give them realistic three-dimensional depth and higher resolution. This modder's resource serves to add the boots as an equipped object.

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Installation Instructions:** Unzip the mod, enter the NPC Replacement folder, and move the six files within (NOT including the optional folder or its contents) to the override.

**Author:** Watcher07

**Description:** Recolors Calo Nord's clothing to be more muted in tone; you wouldn't expect a famous bounty hunter to run around in bright colors, would you? Note that this does not allow you to play as Calo, nor does it add the custom blaster skin or republic uniform skin seen in the screenshots.

**Screenshots:** [Here](http://imgur.com/a/KoIKD)

### HD Darth Malak

**Name:** [HD Darth Malak](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/980-hd-darth-malak/)

**Author:** Dark Hope

**Description:** Drastically improves the overall graphical quality of Malak. The screenshots really don't do this mod justice, it's excellent.

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Download Instructions:** Do not download the .tga file.

**Installation Instructions:** If intending to use CineMalak below (recommended!), select your preferred head texture from the Malak (Red Eyes) or Malak (Blue Eyes) folders and move the files within to your override. You can ignore N_DarthMalak01.tga, unless you do not want to use CineMalak, in which case you should also move it to your override.

___

### CineMalak

**Name:** [CineMalak - HD Darth Malak](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2787-cinemalak-hd-malak-retexture/)

**Author:** PoopaPoppaPalpatine

**Description:** Built off of Dark Hope's texture above, CineMalak is a redesign which the author contextualizes as making the clothing look more like a real-world movie costume. I don't think this is an invalid description, but I would rather contextualize it as just making the costume look realistic *full stop*. Malak's outfit, even in Dark Hope's interpretation, doesn't look like real clothing. This mod does a wonderful job of giving his suit the little things - more realistic cloth textures, stitch lines, armor clasps - that make it both HD *and* believable as real clothing.

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Installation Instructions:** The downloaded file is a loose .tga, not inside an archive. For this mod, just move the downloaded file (N_DarthMalak01.tga) to your override directly.

### Detran's Darth Revan

**Name:** [Detran's Darth Revan](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2350-detrans-darth-revan/)

**Author:** Detran

**Description:** Drastically improves the overall graphical quality of Revan. Just as with the above mod, the screenshots really don't do this mod justice, the texture is excellent.

**Installation Instructions:** Make a copy of the file and rename it PMBJ01, then move all files to override.

**Author:** Dark Hope

**Description:** Continuing her tradition of naming things as unhelpfully as possible, this is a clothing pack for male commoners by Dark Hope. To those put off by the default changes to N_CommM07 and N_CommM08, don't worry, we don't use the ones that alter the base design.

**Author:** Stormie97, Patch by JCarter

**Description:** This mod is an all-in-one overhaul for Juhani, including a new body texture, new unique clothing, and a custom lightsaber for our favorite angry Cathar. Bear in mind we don't use this mod's changes to Juhani's head, instead relying on the below mod.

**Name:** [Juhani Real Cathar Head](http://deadlystream.com/files/file/702-juhani-real-cathar-head/)

**Author:** Miro42

**Description:** Juhani's head model has always been a disappointing reminder of the limitations of low resolution. This mod makes the best attempt of any I've seen so far to portray Juhani as truly Cathar, without going to extremes or failing to overcome the limitations of her original facial design.

**Author:** JCarter426

**Description:** Find it strange that all Sith at the Korriban academy are apparently officers and not Dark Jedi? This mod reskins all the Jedi in the Academy to wear proper robes, as well as fixing several other appearance issues on Korriban.

**Name:** [Cloaked Jedi Robes](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1378-jcs-fashion-line-i-cloaked-jedi-robes-for-k1/)

**Author:** JCarter426

**Description:** If you preferred the robes in KOTOR 2, as most seem to, does JC have a mod for you. Cloaked Jedi Robes migrates all of the robe types from KOTOR 2 straight into KOTOR, while still managing to retain the unique color schemes of the original (should you choose to use one of the two options for that, anyway!). If you've long sought robe consistency across the two games, look no further.

### JC's Jedi Tailor

**Name:** [JC's Jedi Tailor](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1477-jcs-jedi-tailor-for-k1/)

**Author:** JCarter426

**Description:** It's very annoying when you've got your party together and you want to show your swag off with color-coordinated outfits, but the game only gives you gaudy blue robes. Worry no longer! JC has given us a solution in the form of a skilled Trandoshan tailor, who will dye your robes on demand—it's also compatible with Cloaked Jedi Robes! He even has some very well-written and lore-friendly dialogue about current events.

**Author:** Dark Hope

**Description:** This mod has nice close-ups at least. This retexture of the stun batons is extremely good, it's visually very distinct ingame even though the weapon itself is small. And do note, even if you as the player don't intend to ever use stun batons, NPCs frequently do, and this mod is high-quality enough to make that visual difference clear.

### Unique Sith Governor

**Name:** [Unique Sith Governor](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2302-unique-sith-governor/)

**Author:** N-DReW25

**Description:** This is a mod I specifically requested because, by default, the Sith Governor on Taris uses the same model and texture as many other Sith in the game, and looks very similar to Malak's apprentice, Bandon. I felt that visually differentiating them a bit would make Bandon seem more unique by comparison, and thus this mod.

That particular image shows the base Quarren in the game; the "dense" Quarren model from the K1CP, without Dark Hope's texture; and the "dense" model with the new texture. Note that, though the mod says that it requires JC's Dense Aliens, it really just requires the K1CP; the same "dense" alien models included in that mod have been integrated into the base community patch for some time now.

**Author:** Thor110

**Description:** The wall-mounted trophies in Davik's estate were based off of basegame creature textures, but did not actually use those texture files: they used a downscaled visual of the vanilla texture for the creatures, which made them look even worse than the vanilla creatures, and especially bad compared to upscaled vanilla creature textures. This mod lets them use the full size of the vanilla texture to map, which makes them look less glaringly low-resolution by comparison.

**Author:** Heyorange, Sith Holocron, JCarter426

**Description:** If you ever want a window into incredibly minor things that I think are really cool, this is the cream of the crop. Vanilla KOTOR doesn't really have much rhyme or reason behind differentiating the appearance of the Sith soldiers you encounter, except for rule of cool. This mod makes the clothing of each rank clear and consistent, with an established breakdown of epaulettes, as well as rank and regiment insignias. New, and thanks to Sith Holocron, these textures have also been further enhanced and upscaled to match the rest of the vanilla game's upscales present in the mod builds.

**Download Instructions:** Download the version of the mod you would like based upon how detailed you want the cockpit skyboxes to appear.

### Revamped FX

**Name:** [Revamped FX](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2581-revamped-fx/)

**Author:** olegkuz1997

**Description:** Rather than a supplementary, this mod by olegkuz should be treated as an alternative to HD Fire and Ice & Hi-Res Beam Effects, already listed above. While this mod edits some files they don't touch and vice-versa, for the most part it replaces those textures. If you would like, you can install this mod and simply not overwrite when prompted to keep most of the changes of Fire and Ice HD & Hi-Res Beam Effects while only adding the files from this mod that those mods don't touch, but if you choose to overwrite this mod will be your main graphical edit for FX.

I'm also looking for opinions about this and whether users prefer it to Fire and Ice HD & HR Beam Effects, so please feel free to drop by the [Discord](https://discord.gg/kotor) and let me know what you think!

### Reflective Lightsaber Blades

**Name:** [New Lightsaber Blade Models](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1846-new_lightsaber_blade_model_k1/)

**Author:** Crazy34

**Description:** With this mod, Crazy34 walked into the community, slammed down one of the most impressive mods ever made for this game, and dared us to do better. Not only have they split the blade texture in two to allow for lightsabers with cores of a different color (currently unsupported in the build release, but hopefully coming soon), they've also added *dynamic reflections* to each and every lightsaber across every area of the game. When you're fighting a Dark Jedi, you're going to see your faces bathed in shifting colors, fading and brightening as you swing your lightsabers; when you ignite your saber in a hallway, it will reflect on the floor and walls, and will realistically increase in intensity as the blade draws nearer to the surface. This is an incredible project, and easily one of the most important—and impressive—mods ever released for KOTOR. In the next few years, it could completely change the face of lightsaber modding.

**Author:** N-DReW25

**Description:** The second option of this mod, the Senni Vek Restoration, restores the initial character who leads you to the Geno'Haradan as one of Hulas's henchmen for the showdown on Tatooine, and is fully vanilla-friendly. The default install, Senni Vek's Ambush, removes Hulas from the final confrontation entirely and replaces him with Senni Vek, featuring altered dialogue which implies that Hulas played you for the entire game and has vanished into the shadows to consolidate his control of the Geno'Haradan.

### Male Twi'lek Diversity

**Name:** [KOTOR 1 Twi'lek Male NPC Diversity](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2228-kotor-1-twilek-male-npc-diversity/)

**Author:** Leilukin

**Description:** Most of the Twi'lek textures used in the game are very samey, ultimately boiling down to just a few alternate textures. This mod makes use of alternate textures created as a modder's resource to significantly differentiate the appearances of many unique Twi'lek NPCs.

If using the Senni Vek Mod, ensure to also re-run the installer and select the compatibility patch for whichever version of that mod you've chosen to use (Senni Vek's Ambush or Senni Vek Restoration).

### Ixgil the Bith

**Name:** [Ixgil the Bith](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2108-ixgil-the-bith/)

**Author:** Crimson Knight

**Description:** The definition of modding hubris. When the power to change the universe at the tips of one's fingers leads a man to spend more time making a mod than the combined thousands of users who ever download it will even see what he did on screen.

There's a wrong soundset. This mod fixes it. The character dies about 5 seconds later. To even download this mod is to question one's sanity.

### Swoop Bike Upgrades

**Name:** [Swoop Bike Upgrades](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2473-kotor-swoop-bike-upgrades/)

**Author:** Salk

**Description:** Originally, swoop bikes in KOTOR were intended to have upgrades available for purchase which would modify their performance. This mod restores two upgrades to the game: one that reduces the speed loss taken when hitting an obstacle, and one which increases acceleration. Right now this mod isn't a perfect implementation of what I'd like, including too few upgrades which are a bit pricey relative to the benefit they give, but I still think it's better for players to have the option to use them than not.

### Jedi Choice Dialogue Enhancement

**Name:** [Jedi Choice Dialogue Enhancement](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2428-jedi-choice-dialogue-enhancement/)

**Author:** Emperor Devon

**Description:** Sometimes you can really feel the disdain for the 11 year olds who were going to play this game in BioWare's writing. "I want to be a Jedi Guardian!" resonates with the soul-crushing hollowness which my mother must have felt when I was 10 and begged for a gameboy.

Anyway, this mod makes the whole Jedi sequence more meaningful by getting rid of the childish response and replacing it with a much more nuanced, alignment-based series of replies.

**Description:** Pazaak players in the original KOTOR cheat, badly. While there's no way to prevent the computer from favoring NPCs in draws, there is a way to drastically reduce their ability to help themselves, and that's to give them all decks one tier lower than what their difficulty says they should have.

**Name:** [Ebon Hawk Camera Replacement](http://deadlystream.com/files/file/827-ebon-hawk-camera-replacement/)

**Author:** LDR

**Description:** By default, the camera angle inside the *Ebon Hawk* is ridiculously close to the PC, which not only makes the PC take up the majority of the screen, it also makes it very hard to see around you. This mod replaces the *Ebon Hawk* camera angle with one closer to the camera angles present in the rest of the game, and similar to KOTOR 2's *Ebon Hawk* camera angle.

### Rebalanced Grenades

**Name:** [Rebalanced Grenades](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2522-rebalanced-grenades/)

**Author:** Timbo

**Description:** In the base-game, grenades typically aren't very useful after the first few planets, once Force powers and the PC's combat capabilities begin to spin up. This mod seeks not only to increase the value of grenades throughout the game but to also make the enemies wielding them more dangerous by tying the total damage output of a grenade to the demolitions stat of the thrower.

### Turret Minigame Remover

**Name:** [Random Turret Minigame Remover](https://www.nexusmods.com/kotor/mods/90)

**Author:** KittyKitty

This mod leaves Trask in with all of his usual actions in the prologue, but removes all of his explanatory dialogue about how the game works.

**Name:** [All Hands on Deck for the Leviathan Prison Break](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2097-all-hands-on-deck-for-the-leviathan-prison-break/)

**Description:** There are a lot of weird inconsistencies with the Leviathan prison break sequence in vanilla, like a LOT.

**Author:** WildKarrde

**Description:** There are many companion dialogues that, in vanilla, can only happen if you bring both the relevant companions to the overworld and run around with them for a bit. In this mod, Wildkarrde borrows a bit from how KOTOR 2 handles companion interactions by allowing many of these dialogues to occur on the Ebon Hawk, so players won't miss them.

### Dark Sacrifice

**Name:** [JC's Romance Enhancement: Dark Sacrifice](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2225-jcs-romance-enhancement-dark-sacrifice-for-k1/)

**Author:** JCarter426

**Description:** As you know, with some small variations KOTOR has a binary ending: Light Side or Dark Side. But it wasn't always so—until quite late in development a very unique ending for Dark Side players who romanced Carth was still being developed, and voice lines were even recorded for it. For unknown reasons this ending was cut, but with this mod it has now been restored. You are not locked into this alternate ending, it's only presented as an option which your character may choose. More than this can't be revealed without giving the ending away, but do note that unless you intend to play as a DS character capable of romancing Carth, this mod will not present any changes. Please also note, a third-party mod by Leilukin not present in this guide makes Carth able to be romanced by male characters, and is compatible with this mod.

**Author:** uwadmin12

**Description:** By default, the "Throw Lightsaber" power is a little weak. Not only does it seem like it takes forever, it does much less damage in a much smaller AoE than powers like Lightning—or even Wave! The goal of this mod is giving Advanced Throw Lightsaber some additional functionality that makes using it worthwhile, namely the inclusion of a knockdown effect on the primary target if that target fails to pass a saving throw. This can make the ability useful for screening particular zones while also dealing damage—still somewhat less effective than Wave, but with more guaranteed damage.

**Name:** [PC Dialogue with Davik's Slave Change](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2214-pc-dialogue-with-daviks-slaves-change/)

**Author:** Leilukin

**Description:** 2003 was a different time, but this mod *really* proves that. In vanilla, if you request a 'massage' from some slaves—which has some sexual implications in Star Wars—you get nothing more than a disgusted remark from some companions. You can even threaten them without consequence. This mod properly amends this, giving you two options: for those deeply bothered by the ability to take advantage of the slaves the option to pressure them into servicing you can be removed entirely, whereas the second retains the massage, but gives Dark Side points for requesting it, as well as adding DS points for threatening the slaves at any point.
