# KOTOR 2 Full Build: Mobile Version

## Installation Notes

If you were linked to this list directly without reading the install instructions, please go back and read them [here](/modding/mod_builds/index.html)! There are several critical setup and general best-practice steps you need to be aware of before beginning the install process. The instructions for how this list is installed are located on that page, not this build!

Although this is a mobile-compatible build, due to required compatibility tools we must use to get this build working, you will need to install all mods to a 'dummy directory' on your PC or Mac *first*, then move that completed package over all at once to your phone in order for the builds to apply properly. This means you **MUST** have a PC or Mac in order to utilize this build for mobile, although you **CAN** install just [MTSLRCM](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1801-mobile-restored-content-mod-mtslrcm/) (the mobile version of The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod) with just your mobile device.

### Install Computer Instructions

It is critical to ensure that you only have **ONE** installation of KOTOR on your device before beginning the installation process. If you have multiple installations, or even just two game executables in different locations, mod installers which are set up to auto-detect your game's installation directory *will* misidentify which one is correct and install the mods wherever they please, probably spiking your whole install in the process. This is particularly important for installing the mobile builds, as I imagine many users will have a PC version of the game installed on the same computer which they are using to set up the mobile builds! For the sake of stability: if you have a copy of KOTOR 2 installed on your device already, compress it to an archive using a program like WinRAR or 7zip, and delete the loose files left over. Then, when the install process is completed, extract the archive where the previous install was located and your local game will be preserved.

Do not, under **ANY CIRCUMSTANCES**, run a TSLPatcher or HoloPatcher executable from within a file archive. You *must* extract all archives before installing mod content, or running an executable. Failure to extract before installing will break your game. Also, ensure you don't extract all the mods to the exact same folder. If, for example, you extract every single mod to a folder called "KOTOR Mods" and run the executable each time, each time you extract you'll be overwriting critical data from the previous mods. Make sure each installer-based mod is extracted to its own folder before running the installer.

Please also bear in mind: if you are asked to direct a TSLPatcher executable to a folder to begin install, that folder should ALWAYS be your 'dummy directory', the folder which contains the KOTOR 2 editable executable, which you will put together during the TSLRCM installation step. For mods that are NOT installed with the TSLPatcher, *unless otherwise noted* their loose-file contents are most often placed directly in the Override directory. Unless you are following specific instructions (the mod author's or my own) that state otherwise, you should not be placing files directly in the dummy directory. You should *never* have any subfolders inside the Modules or Override folders within the dummy directory.

As a final note, be aware that the TSLPatcher executable utilized in the installation process of many of these mods (frustratingly) does not function on multi-monitor setups. If you have more than one monitor, you will need to disable your second while installing the mods, but you can re-enable it once the installation process is complete.

### Mac OS Users

It is *required* to be able to run executable files in order to install this list. A wrapper program like Wineskin or some other option which will allow you to run executable files is necessary in order to proceed.

### Updating from a Prior Build

If you currently have a prior mod build version installed and would like to update to the current Revision, due to the importance of install order to the mod builds' function, there is unfortunately no way to do so without resetting to a fresh install and reinstalling the new build iteration on top. To do this, just perform the zeroing step listed above: uninstall your game, delete all remaining contents in the game directory (remember, frequently, especially on the Steam release of the game, mod content *will not* be uninstalled as part of the application's uninstallation), and then reinstall the game before applying the new build version.

## Mod List

### TSLRCM

**Name:** [Mobile TSLRCM (The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod)](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1801-mobile-restored-content-mod-mtslrcm/)

**Author:** zbyl2, DarthStoney, Hassat Hunter & VarsityPuppet

**Description:** The whole reason why you would mod KOTOR 2, the legendary mod that includes bugfixes, restored content, and altered scenes to return the game to what it was meant to be. This mod isn't just essential—it's mandatory.

**Category & Tier:** Bugfix, Immersion, Mechanics Change & Restored Content / 1 - Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** YES, *but* you must install the version of MTSLRCM which corresponds to your language of choice.

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Installation Instructions:** For now, disregard the installation instructions included in the mod, as we will be dragging over the completed installation in batch. Once the mod is downloaded, extract it to a location of your choice on your PC/Mac and delete everything inside the dlc folder except for the 'mods_*x*' directory, the 'x' corresponding to your language of choice.

You now need to download [this file](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1321-kotor-2-editable-executable/) and place it within your mods_*x* folder. **This file is critical for future installations to function properly**. This is a dummy .exe file which lets later mods install to the right place on your device, and without error. We will delete it as one of the final steps of this installation process, as it's only needed for installations to function normally.

From this point forward all mods are installed as if the mods_*x* folder is the **main game directory**. For any TSLPatcher executable which asks you to select the main game folder/folder with the executable in it, you will select the mods_*x* folder. Similarly, any mods directing you to place their files within the game's override folder will be placed within the override folder within mods_*x*.

### TSLRCM Tweak Pack

**Name:** [TSLRCM Tweak Pack](http://deadlystream.com/files/file/296-unofficial-tslrcm-tweak-pack/)

**Author:** Pavijan (update by Fair Strides)

**Description:** Reverts and otherwise modifies certain TSLRCM settings to make the game more sensible and internally consistent (mostly unrestoring content which was likely intentionally cut by Obsidian). This includes removing Jedi Padawan Kaevee.

**Masters:** TSLRCM

**Category & Tier:** Patch / 1 - Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** PARTIAL - All components can be installed *except* for Trayus Mandalore Conversation.

**Installation Method:** Multi-Run TSLPatcher

**Installation Instructions:** Don't use the complete installer, instead selecting the individual component installer—this is *critical* for compatibility, not just to choose specific options. The installer for this mod will need to be run 7 times, once to install each of the options we'll be using: Kaevee Removal Parts 1 & 2, Saedhe's Head, Atton at the End, Kreia-Atris Dialogue Tweak, Trayus Mandalore Conversation, and Trayus Sith Lord Masks.

___

### Silent Sion

**Name:** [Silent Sion Restoration](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2426-silent-sion-restoration/)

**Author:** Emperor Devon

**Description:** Another TSLRCM change I am not personally thrilled with--when Sion encounters the Exile for the first time in TSLRCM on the *Harbinger*, he speaks to them a line of warning. That engagement takes so much tension out of the scene, and this mod reverts it to the vanilla standard: when Sion appears at the end of the hall he only slowly walks towards the party, threatening and menacing.

**Masters:** TSLRCM

**Category & Tier:** Immersion / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File

**Installation Instructions:** Move just 153sion.dlg to the override.

### Thematic KOTOR 2 Companions

**Name:** [Thematic KOTOR 2 Companions](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2662-thematic-kotor-2-companions/)

**Author:** Sniggles & JCarter426

**Description:** In the original KOTOR, BioWare did a few wacky things with character progression. Obsidian, not wanting to be outdone, decided to be even worse by just straight-up copying the statlines of several KOTOR companions for KOTOR 2 companions!

As part of the Thematic series of mods by JC and myself, Thematic KOTOR 2 Companions is a rework of companion starting attributes, skills, feats and powers to lock all companions into having the exact amount of bonuses they should for their level, as well as retuning several of their setups to more closely match the characters' behaviors and backstories. The goal is to ensure that companions' statlines are not only thematically consistent, but also broadly mechanically balanced, to better-incentivize the use of under-utilized party members.

**Masters:** TSLRCM

**Category & Tier:** Mechanics Change / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** TSLPatcher

**Installation Instructions:** If you would like to have Visas's class as Sith Assassin, install the "Standard + Sith Assassin Visas" option. Otherwise, simply install "Standard."

___

### Saving Throw Fixes

**Name:** [Prestige Class Saving Throw Fixes](http://deadlystream.com/files/file/828-tsl-prestige-class-saving-throw-fixes/)

**Author:** Rovan

**Description:** For some reason, some prestige classes in KOTOR 2 have worse saving throws than their predecessor class. This mod fixes this, ensuring that the more advanced classes always have slightly better throws.

**Category & Tier:** Mechanics Change / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Installation Instructions:** I advise users to only install the Jedi Master/Sith Lord fixes.

___

### Robes with Shadows

**Name:** [Robes with Shadows for TSL](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2075-robes-with-shadows-for-tsl/)

**Author:** PapaZinos

**Description:** What use, I ask you, is the Soft Shadows setting ingame if your shadows are still 10 polygons? This mod gives all robes proper shadows that match their models more directly, for that extra touch of realism.

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 3 - Suggested

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Installation Instructions:** Extract the mod. Ignore the included subfolders, and move just the files in the base folder to your override. Overwrite when prompted.

___

### K2CP

**Name:** [K2 Community Patch](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1280-kotor-2-community-patch/)

**Author:** Multiple; A Future Pilot, JCarter426 Curates

**Description:** A community bugfix and general improvement patch for KOTOR 2 meant to be a supplement to TSLRCM, fixing bugs that TSLRCM didn't catch or viewed too minor to address; highly recommended.

**Masters:** TSLRCM

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement & Bugfix / 1 - Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** TSLPatcher Mod

**Installation Instructions:** Remember, warnings during an installation are normal—errors are not.

___

### Remote Tells Influence

**Name:** [Remote Tells Influence](https://www.gamefront.com/games/knights-of-the-old-republic-ii/file/remote-tells-influence) and [**PATCH**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/af3h6y793f3zjxq/Remote%20Tells%20Influence%20Patch%20for%20TSLRCM.zip?dl=0)

**Author:** tk102, patch by Leilukin

**Description:** This is going to require a bit of an explanation. I personally believe this mod breaks immersion—so why add it? The bottom-line is that KOTOR 2's influence system is asinine, and major plot points are locked behind very high—or very low—influence with several companions. Your influence with companions is also extremely obfuscated, only really discernible by their LS/DS alignment relative to your alignment, but this is a very buggy system which breaks with high Charisma values on the player, or with certain feats. There is no other way ingame to tell what your influence is without this mod. I mark it as optional because it *does* break immersion, but for many players I think having a system to determine influence will be extremely important for enjoyment of the story.

**Category & Tier:** Mechanics Change / 4 - Optional

**Non-English Functionality:** NO

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod & Patch

### No Mines on Malachor

**Name:** [No Mines on Malachor](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2459-no-mines-on-malachor-only-gas/)

**Author:** Thor110

**Description:** I always liked the idea of Malachor being a ruined and cracked world, with fissures that spew gas onto the surface at great risk to the player. This effect is somewhat diminished, though, when the player can SEE THE MINES that cause that gas to be produced. It makes avoiding the traps easy. This mod removes the visual mines, so the player can only guess where there are gas vents.

**Category & Tier:** Appearance Change / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** HoloPatcher

**Installation Instructions:** Be aware that this mod is one of the very few in the builds that is installed via the HoloPatcher, a new install method. For your purposes as the enduser, it functions almost identically to the TSLPatcher.

___

### Ritual and Water Textures

**Name:** [Ritual and Water Textures](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2286-freedon-nadds-tomb-ritual-and-water-textures/)

**Author:** Nehua

**Description:** A very nice retexture of the ritual "dome" during the party assault on Freedon Nadd's tomb. Note that the water texture from this mod is not (and cannot be) used for game stability, due to the way the mod is packaged; we will only use the ritual texture.

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Category & Tier:** Bugfix / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** NO

**Installation Method:** TSLPatcher Mod

**Download Instructions:** Use the V2 version of the mod.

___

### Honest Merchant

**Name:** [Honest Merchant](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1904-honest-merchant-tslrcm/)

**Author:** TK-664

**Description:** For those gluttons for punishment among us, this mod reverts the inventory of Dendis Dobo, the honest but struggling merchant on Citadel Station, to its pre-TSLRCM state. In TSLRCM all merchants have improved inventories, but with this mod Dendis has only a pittance of poor goods, to represent the cost of his honesty and exactly how much his business is struggling compared to his brother.

**Masters:** TSLRCM

### JC's Minor Fixes

**Name:** [JC's Minor Fixes](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1215-jcs-minor-fixes-for-k2/)

**Author:** JCarter426

**Description:** This collection from JCarter includes many small fixes, upscaled textures, and other helpful improvements too small to warrant their own mod, but well worth it when compiled as it is here.

**Category & Tier:** Bugfix & Graphics Improvement & Immersion / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Author:** DarthParametric

**Description:** In vanilla, Twi'lek thigh-high boots are painted on the character's texture rather than added to their equipped clothing as an item, which would give them realistic three-dimensional depth and higher resolution. This mod adds the boots as an equipped object, increasing the quality and appearance of the boot textures.

### Reflective Lightsaber Blades

**Name:** [New Lightsaber Blade Models](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1847-new_lightsaber_blade_model_tsl/)

**Author:** Crazy34

**Description:** With this mod, Crazy34 walked into the community, slammed down one of the most impressive mods ever made for this game, and dared us to do better. Not only have they split the blade texture in two to allow for lightsabers with cores of a different color (currently unsupported in the build release, but hopefully coming soon), they've also added *dynamic reflections* to each and every lightsaber across almost every area of the game. When you're fighting a Dark Jedi, you're going to see your faces bathed in shifting colors, fading and brightening as you swing your lightsabers; when you ignite your saber in a hallway, it will reflect on the floor and walls, and will realistically increase in intensity as the blade draws nearer to the surface. This is an incredible project, and easily one of the most important—and impressive—mods ever released for KOTOR. In the next few years, it could completely change the face of lightsaber modding.

I **strongly** recommend the 1k version for mobile devices; it will be hard to see the full benefit of the 2k version on a mobile device, the 2k version is a much larger filesize, and the larger texture size could interfere with module loading on the mobile version.

**Installation Instructions:** After this mod has finished installing, if you are using the K2CP, extract the K2CP once again—*do not* re-run its TSLPatcher! Open the TSLPatchdata folder and move 231teld.mdl and 231teld.mdx to your override, and overwrite when prompted.

**Author:** darth_gil

**Description:** Thorium charges are used to blow open heavily-fortified rooms, of which there are two in the game. There are also two thorium charges in the vanilla game--*however*. One of them is hidden behind completing a quest and then re-checking the merchant Akkere's inventory (which you are never informed has updated), *and* Akkere can die during the fighting on Dantooine. I recommend using this mod, which adds a thorium charge on Dxun (where it most logically would be), just to save a little bit of hassle.

### PartySwap

**Name:** [PartySwap](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/544-partyswap/)

**Author:** DarthTyren & Leilukin

**Description:** PartySwap is a legendary mod, and one of the best ever made for KOTOR 2. Through some unobtrusive scripting magic, it allows you to bring both the Disciple and Handmaiden with you as companions simultaneously, without removing another companion from the party wheel. You can experience all their content and use them both throughout the entire campaign, as was originally intended by Obsidian.

Be aware, however, that PartySwap *does* require some fourth wall-breaking elements, including the need to use a script and dialogue window to summon the Handmaiden in order for its party trickery to work. I don't like this any more than you probably do, but I still think having both the Handmaiden and Disciple is far superior to having only one of them, and I think it's an acceptable price for what the mod provides.

The mod gives you a stim to manage the Handmaiden and Disciple (spawning & despawning them) which you use to run the script. This stim appears in the *shields* quickbar at the bottom-left of the screen, however; be aware of this, since it doesn't show up in the normal stims category!

**Name:** [Prologue Item Recovery](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2211-prologue-item-recovery/)

**Description:** A mod made at my request by Leilukin, for which I'm very grateful! Originally, even if you play the short prologue on the Ebon Hawk, you're not able to keep your items from that sequence, even though none of them are overpowered or unreasonable for that stage of the game. This mod gives them back to you, so long as T3 is able to breach the door to the security room in the hanger.

### No Health Regeneration

**Name:** [No Health Regeneration](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2530-no-health-regeneration/)

**Author:** offthegridmorty

**Description:** Having health regen by default in KOTOR 2 is bad for many reasons: it makes an already easy game easier; it negates the benefit of the health regeneration feat they added; and it makes the use & crafting of medkits and other health-restoring tools much less useful. I played with this mod and the game was still pretty easy by the end, but it was WAY more fun early on. It made me have to worry about health and especially healing items for quite a bit more time, which preserved the challenge beyond Telos.

### Thematic Sith Lords

**Author:** Sniggles & JCarter426

**Description:** The results of my first foray into KOTOR modding. Everybody knows that the Sith Lords in KOTOR 2 are disappointing as bosses—the goal of this mod is to make them thematically unique, so that fights against them are fun and that certain character builds excel at fighting some Lords and struggle against others.

**Masters:** TSLRCM

**Category & Tier:** Mechanics Change / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** TSLPatcher Mod

**Installation Instructions:** First choose your base install option, either Standard or No Force Rating (the latter removes the inherent DS alignment bonus to saves in some modules, which also gives an equivalent malus to LS characters in those modules). After this is installed, if you would like for Visas to ambush you as a Sith Assassin (which is a *very difficult fight*--remember, she will have Sneak Attack, and that fight forcibly stuns you), re-run the patcher and also install that option.

___

### Thematic Jedi Masters

**Name:** [Thematic Jedi Masters](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2633-thematic-jedi-masters/)

**Author:** Sniggles & JCarter426

**Description:** The much younger brother of Thematic Sith Lords, Thematic Jedi Masters was born of me discovering that all of the Masters except Atris have the same class (Guardian), and one doesn't even have any Force Points for your encounter! These fights were extremely half-baked, and that's where this mod comes in. Unlike Thematic Sith Lords the design philosophy was not of a rock-paper-scissors style (so you aren't going to find a tremendous glaring weakness with a Master as you might on a Lord) but rather to accentuate a given master's strengths in line with their respective natures.

**Author:** Effix

**Description:** Bao-Dur gets more than a little screwed. He can't wear robes because they never made a model for them with his mechanical arm cutout, and he can't wear heavy armor because they didn't make a model for that, either. Especially with his stat distribution in mind, that makes him kind of garbage. This mod restores the ability to give him heavy armor, at least, which gives him at least a bit better utility.

**Description:** For being a crystal which is specifically attuned to the player, your little pet rock wasn't very malleable. This mod adds a ton of different alignment levels for your player crystal based upon your alignment and class, fixes several bugs with the crystal, and also allows the player to attune the crystal at workbenches when Kreia isn't available.

### Sion and a Male Exile

**Author:** Leilukin

**Description:** I find that Sion's character comes off completely one-dimensional, ruining both his own interesting character arc and his relationship with Kreia, unless he can express a feeling of sentimentality for the Exile. Unfortunately this is conveyed via a romantic obsession between Sion and the player, and by default this is locked to a female Exile. In the interests of presenting Sion at his best as a character, this mod causes Sion to become obsessed with the player regardless of their gender.

**Description:** This mod brings to KOTOR 2 the same concept that the original game had with repairing HK. In addition to moderately increasing HK's stats over the course of the repairs (a much-welcome improvement, as droids in KOTOR 2 tend to underperform anyway), this mod also allows you to visually see HK become his old self again as the HK-50 components are gradually integrated, fixed and painted-over. The mod even includes some excellent reskins of the HK-50s and -51s! **AND** it's fully-voiced in a seamless way using original game dialogue! You'll have to forgive me, this is like a wet dream for me, seriously.

### Companion Clothes

**Author:** Ol' Cappy

**Description:** Giving companions a unique version of their default clothes so they can keep their 'standard' look throughout the entire game while still having mechanically powerful equipment is a very common mod type. I typically don't like these mods, not because I disagree with the premise but because I tend to balk at +10 WIS modifiers on starting gear. Ol' Cappy, in my opinion, does it right here—these are unique clothes for most of the human companions which don't give insane bonuses, but instead small, rational, and most importantly balanced, lore-friendly and internally-consistent bonuses. These items are never going to be the best your team can get, but they are flavorful additions which will let you keep them in their default get a bit longer, if you so choose.

### Remove Duplicate TGA/TPC

**Name:** [Remove Duplicate TGA/TPC](https://www.nexusmods.com/kotor/mods/1384) OR [Bash script for MacOS/Linux](https://pastebin.com/6WCN122S)

**Author:** Flachzangen, bash version by /u/th3w1zard1

**Description:** This is a script written by Flachzangen which allows you to remove duplicate .TGA or .TPC files in your game directory. Files with the .TPC filetype take priority, so for several of the patches we've downloaded which are of the .tga filetype, we need to delete any .TPC duplicates in order to get them to read properly. That's what this script will do. It is **CRITICAL** to use this script, as, if .tpc files take priority in some instances, the game will crash.

**Category & Tier:** Patch / 1 - Essential

**Installation Method:** .bat Patcher

**Installation Instructions:** Place DelDuplicateTGA-TPC (or the bash script version) in your main game folder (NOT override!), run it, say that **TPC should be deleted** and do not manually confirm. If you are on a Mac or other device that cannot run .bat files and the bash script is not an option for you to use, a list of all the files you will need to manually delete can be found [here](/modding/mod_builds/k1/delete.html).

**MAKE SURE THIS SCRIPT RUNS PROPERLY!** On some operating systems, overzealous antivirus setups, or filepaths with particular characters in them it may fail. If the file outputs "Finished, Press any key to continue" but does not list any files it deleted, it *is not working*, and if it does not work it *will* crash your game. You can try to resolve this by moving your Override folder to a different location (I recommend a subfolder in your Documents or Downloads directories), putting the .bat file there and running it through that directory, but if that doesn't work you will need to manually go through and delete the duplicates from the link above.

### TOMB

**Name:** [Thematic Obscured Mausoleum Burial](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2663-thematic-obscured-mausoleum-burial/)

**Author:** Sniggles & JCarter426

**Description:** The mod that took us way, *way* longer than it should have. In brief, this mod serves to fix many idiosyncrasies with the visions encountered in the Tomb of Ludo Kressh, as well as adding more player agency and dynamism into the final encounter with your doppelganger and the vision-Revan. For a full breakdown of all changes, please see the attached document on the mod page.

Do note--the fights here can be quite challenging depending upon your choices. Winning them is not mandatory, however, and you will still be able to continue even if you lose at some point.

### iOS Case Sensitivity Fix

**Name:** [Case Sensitivity Fix](https://github.com/DeadlyStream/KOTORCaseFixer/releases/tag/v1.0) (or Terminal line commands for non-Windows OSes—see below)

**Author:** JCarter426

**Description:** KOTOR on mobile devices has case sensitivity. To make these mods function properly on iOS, the files must be batch-renamed to their case-sensitive versions. This step is **ONLY NEEDED IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE PLAYING ON AN iOS DEVICE**!

**Category & Tier:** Bugfix / 1 - Essential

**Installation Instructions:** Before proceeding, delete the dummy executable used to facilitate the mod installations. If the device you're currently using runs a Windows OS, download one of the executable files from the linked github page matching your operating system's architecture (32-bit or 64-bit; google which your Windows OS is if you're not sure), place the file in the main dummy directory which you have created to install the mods to (NOT the override folder), and run the executable.

If you are on MacOS or Linux, first, run Terminal and navigate to your mods_english directory with the cd command.

`cd [full filepath to mods_english on your device]`

Then, enter the following command:

`find . -depth | xargs -n 1 rename -f 's/(.*)\/([^\/]*)/$1\/\L$2/' {} \;`

If you are prompted for permission, rerun the command with elevated privileges using the sudo command.

`sudo find . -depth | xargs -n 1 rename -f 's/(.*)\/([^\/]*)/$1\/\L$2/' {} \;`

For more information:

* [cd command](https://linuxize.com/post/linux-cd-command/)

* [sudo command](https://linuxize.com/post/sudo-command-in-linux/)

## IMPORTANT: Final Installation Instructions

First, navigate to mods_english's override directory, locate, and delete two files, if they're present: "CM_baremetal.tga" and "CM_baremetal.txi".

Once that's completed, if you did not complete the case sensitivity step, delete the dummy executable file in mods_english which you downloaded at the beginning of the process now. Your install is now complete! You can now connect your mobile device to your system, and move the dlc folder containing the mods_english folder to the install point for your device:

**iOS**:
On iOS, they are placed in iTunes > Apps > Documents, in the same spot that the ‘saves’ folder goes.

**ANDROID**:
On Android the files should be placed in /Home/Android/data/com.aspyr.swkotor2/files/
