**Name:** [Main Menu Fix for Widescreen](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1138-tsl-main-menu-model-fix-for-widescreen/)

**Author:** DarthParametric

**Description:** A fix for TSL's stretched menu when playing the game widescreen; only use with the non-beta Steam version, or any widescreen-patched game from any other retailer.

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement & Bugfix / 3 - Suggested

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Installation Instructions:** FApply the contents of the "for override folder". If you would like to have the TSLRCM version of the KOTOR 2 logo on your main menu, you will need to BOTH move the contents of the "FOR TSLRCM" folder to your override, as well as the contents of the separate download "Updated_TSLRCM_Logo_v1.8.6".

**Name:** [K1 Cutscenes Rescaled](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2503-k2-cutscenes-rescaled/)

**Author:** Pops Maellard

**Description:** This mod is a *killer* cutscene retexture, using a very clean, very sharp AI pass to upscale and clarify the cutscenes.

Unfortunately, there's a price for the quality of Pops's work: the files are extremely hefty, coming in at a whopping 15 gigs. This mod is by far the better of the two cutscene mods available, but if you're on limited data, a poor connection or have limited drive space, it's a much better idea to use naelavok's remastered cutscenes below rather than Pops's version here. If you've got the space and the speed, though, this is where it's at.

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 1 - Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Installation Instructions:** Choose the resolution option which most closely fits your monitor's screen size during the download process. Additionally, choose 30fps or 60fps (this is your preference). When installing, there will be several optional files based on how dialogue in cutscenes are displayed (floating text or not, etc). Which of these you choose is your preference; use the mod screenshots to determine. There will also be a compatch for TSLRCM in the installation, make sure to apply that.

If you experience issues with the game minimizing during cutscenes, it might be necessary to go to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7euNu1Tt5E) and following the instructions to use RAD tools to "upscale" the cutscenes to match your exact resolution, though I have not personally attempted this so I don't know how much time it would take to complete. I would estimate around 8 hours, which is the typical time it takes for the native movies to be scaled to 1920x1080 using the same system, but remember that this would be a fully-automated process.

**Name:** [KOTOR Remastered Cutscenes](https://www.nexusmods.com/kotor2/mods/1066/)

**Author:** naelavok 

**Description:** Using predictive AI, /u/naelavok has upscaled the cutscenes for both games out of their horrendous default resolution, to be much more crisp and viewable. A movie replacer like this is necessary to fix the fullscreen bug (plus they're just *really* good), so it's hugely recommended to use it whether you experience issues with fullscreen play or not.

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Components, possible .bat patcher

**Installation Instructions:** Use only Pops Maellard's cutscenes or this version by naelavok. To install, choose the resolution option which most closely fits your monitor's screen size during the download process.

**Name:** [K1 Loading Screen Rescaled](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2622-k2-loading-screen-rescaled/)

**Author:** Pops Maellard

**Description:** If you decide not to use Pops Mallard's cutscene mod above, this mod is a standalone version of their enhanced legal screen (which I personally enjoy) that you can download as a standalone.

**Name:** [Workbench Upgrade Screen Camera Tweak](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1743-workbench-upgrade-screen-camera-tweak-for-tsl/)

**Author:** DarthParametric

**Description:** This mod pulls the camera on the Workbench in closer to show off the textures of what you're editing better. Works best at high resolution and with texture mods, which is why it's listed here in widescreen improvements.

**Name:** [Ultrawide UI Letterboxing Fix for UniWS](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1892-ultrawide-ui-dialogletterboxing-fix-for-uniws-219/)

**Author:** Verinen

**Description:** If you are playing KOTOR 2 in widescreen via the UniWS application and *not* natively through the game's most recent patch on Steam/GoG, this mod purports to provide bugfree ultrawide resolution support along with letterboxing options to make the game playable at certain aspect ratios. As I don't have an ultrawide monitor, I can't test this myself, but I list it for those whom it may help.
