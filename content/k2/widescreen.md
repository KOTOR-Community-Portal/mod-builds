**Name:** [KOTOR Remastered Cutscenes](https://www.nexusmods.com/kotor2/mods/1066/)

**Author:** naelavok 

**Description:** Using predictive AI, /u/naelavok has upscaled the cutscenes for both games out of their horrendous default resolution, to be much more crisp and viewable. A movie replacer like this is necessary to fix the fullscreen bug (plus they're just *really* good), so it's hugely recommended to use it whether you experience issues with fullscreen play or not.

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 1 - Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Components, possible .bat patcher

**Installation Instructions:** Choose the resolution option which most closely fits your monitor's screen size during the download process. If using TSLRCM (you'd better be), also download the Patch file corresponding to your chosen resolution.

After the files are downloaded and you've replaced the movies in your movies folder, *if you are NOT on the most recent Steam or GoG patch*, you'll need to hex edit your executable to run them properly; see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7euNu1Tt5E) for visual instructions on how to do so (you can skip the first part about using RAD tools to upscale the movies). Note that the UniWS widescreen program which you should've already used to apply basic widescreen function *may* automatically edit the necessary hex strings for you, but it won't always; checking to make sure that the hexes for your resolution are the ones set is important to make sure this mod functions!

If you experience issues with minimizations during cutscenes, it should be possible to return to Xuul's video above and run the RAD tools on the new movies to re-scale them to fit your exact monitor's resolution, though I haven't attempted this so I don't know the amount of time it would take. I would estimate around 8 hours, which is the typical time it takes for the native movies to be scaled to 1920x1080 using the same system, but remember that this would be a fully-automated process.

**Author:** DarthParametric

**Description:** This mod pulls the camera on the Workbench in closer to show off the textures of what you're editing better. Works best at high resolution and with texture mods, which is why it's listed here in widescreen improvements.

**Name:** [Ultrawide UI Letterboxing Fix for UniWS](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1892-ultrawide-ui-dialogletterboxing-fix-for-uniws-219/)

**Author:** Verinen

**Description:** If you are playing KOTOR 2 in widescreen via the UniWS application and *not* natively through the game's most recent patch on Steam/GoG, this mod purports to provide bugfree ultrawide resolution support along with letterboxing options to make the game playable at certain aspect ratios. As I don't have an ultrawide monitor, I can't test this myself, but I list it for those whom it may help.

**Category & Tier:** Bugfix / 4 - Optional

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod
