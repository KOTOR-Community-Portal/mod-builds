# KOTOR 2 Full Build

## Installation Notes

If you were linked to this list directly without reading the install instructions, please go back and read them [here](/modding/mod_builds/index.html)! There are several critical setup and general best-practice steps you need to be aware of before beginning the install process. The instructions for how this list is installed are located on that page, not this build!

### Zeroing Step

Unless you have *freshly* installed the game or have never installed KOTOR 2 previously, please blank-slate your setup: uninstall the game, delete the full contents of your game's directory (the entire folder where the executable file previously was located; this does **NOT** always happen automatically when the game is uninstalled), and reinstall the game. A significant amount of troubleshooting support we offer is the result of leftover game files or file corruption from a game which was installed many years ago. Performing this zeroing step helps to ensure your local copy is fresh, uncorrupted, and free of any old mod data.

Once you have your freshly-installed copy of the game, please attempt to set your main game directory and all subfolders as *not* read-only. This is because executable mods will need to modify the files therein directly to install properly. Some operating systems (particularly Windows OS 8+) will lock the settings on these folders depending on their locations, so for many systems it will not be possible to actually pull them out of their read-only state, but it is important to at at least attempt to change the folders, as on some operating systems it is possible, and therefore necessary for a functional install.

### KOTOR 2 on Steam

If you are playing KOTOR 2 on Steam, *please* check that you're not subscribed to any content on the Workshop--yes, even if you're double-triple-super positive you're not. At least 2-3 times a month we have people come in asking for tech support swearing that they're not subbed to anything on the Workshop, then they go check and it turns out that they subbed to TSLRCM a decade ago and completely forgot about it. It's not fun to find that out after you start your game.

Checking is very simple: just go to your Steam library, right-click KOTOR 2 and select properties, then go to the Workshop tab and confirm nothing appears in the list. Doing this not only helps you avoid major errors during the install process, it also helps us to help you in the event that something goes wrong with your install, because we'll know immediately that the Workshop isn't the problem.

### TSLPatcher Installation Requirements

Do not, under **ANY CIRCUMSTANCES**, run a TSLPatcher or HoloPatcher executable from within a file archive (IE a compressed file like a .rar, .zip, .7z, etc). You *must* extract all archives before installing mod content, or running an executable. Failure to extract before installing will break your game. Also, ensure you don't extract all the mods to the exact same folder. If, for example, you extract every single mod to a folder called "KOTOR Mods" and run the executable each time, each time you extract you'll be overwriting critical data from the previous mods. Make sure each installer-based mod is extracted to its own folder before running the installer.

Please also bear in mind: if you are asked to direct a TSLPatcher or Holopatcher executable to a folder to begin install, that folder should ALWAYS be the main game folder, where your game's .exe file is located (or the symlink to that folder created in the optional Quicker TSLPatching step, discussed further below). For mods that are NOT installed with the TSLPatcher or Holopatcher, *unless otherwise noted* their loose-file contents are placed directly in the Override directory. Unless you are following specific instructions (the mod author's or my own) that state otherwise, you should not be placing files in the game's main directory or Modules folder. You should *never* have any subfolders inside the Modules or Override folders.

As a final note, be aware that the TSLPatcher executable utilized in the installation process of many of these mods (frustratingly) does not always function on multi-monitor setups. If you have more than one monitor, you may need to disable your second while installing the mods, but you can re-enable it once the installation process is complete.

### Single Install

It is critical to ensure that you only have **ONE** installation of KOTOR on your device before beginning the installation process. If you have multiple installations, or even just two game executables in different locations, mod installers which are set up to auto-detect your game's installation directory *will* misidentify which one is correct and install the mods wherever they please, probably spiking your whole install in the process. If you want to make a backup of your vanilla gamestate, make sure to compress the entire game into an archive (.rar, .zip, .7z, etc.) before starting the install process.

### Known Bugs

* Although all instances of this error should now be fixed, some textures may still have a partial transparency effect applied to them (you will be able to faintly see through them, or part of them, as if they were a slightly more opaque hologram). If you encounter any instances of such textures please report them so I can fix any leftovers.
* There are significant camera angle errors in the scene where Carth is on the *Sojourn*'s bridge approaching Telos to engage the *Ravager*. We currently don't know why this is and are looking into it actively. The scene still plays properly, including audible dialogue, the camera simply doesn't face the proper direction when doing so.
* For some users, the game may very rarely crash on load when trying to enter a new area due to a data overflow. This is extremeley uncommon and most users should never encounter it, but it is impossible to fully prevent. Fortunately, it is easy to fix if it does happen: simply temporarily disable the 'Frame Buffer Effects' and "Soft Shadows" settings in your advanced graphics options, proceed through the load screen, then re-enable the settings once on the other side. Again, most players should never encounter this.

### Updating from a Prior Build

If you currently have a prior mod build version installed and would like to update to the current Revision, due to the importance of install order to the mod builds' function, there is unfortunately no way to do so without resetting to a fresh install and reinstalling the new build iteration on top. To do this, just perform the zeroing step listed above: uninstall your game, delete all remaining contents in the game directory (remember, frequently, especially on the Steam release of the game, mod content *will not* be uninstalled as part of the application's uninstallation), and then reinstall the game before applying the new build version.

### Linux Players

Please note, case-sensitivity is an issue with many Linux systems (as you may expect). For those not running a case-insensitive distro, you will need to batch-lowercase any mod files--*any* mod files, not just the files that end up in your override directory. It's likely you will need to both lowercase the files before installing any installer-based mod and then again at the end of the process as a batch action in your game directory and all subfolders, as the TSLPatcher/HoloPatcher will generate several files as part of their install processes which will have capitals that are misread.

Most Linux players appear to be using Proton these days, and for those that do there are some known issues with it, both related to crashes with certain older Proton versions and with rendering issues on newer Proton releases. I don't use Linux and don't feel qualified to try to summarize the issues and fixes here, but just be aware if you run into trouble there are several pins in the [Discord's](https://discord.gg/qw7NhM6EW5) #tech_support channel dealing with Proton and how to resolve both issues (the crashing & rendering problems).

### Total Filesize on Disk

For your reference, the total filesize of all mods before extraction, excluding movies, is approximately 6.5GB. The total size of the install when extracted, including basegame files but excluding upscaled movies, is approximately 15.5GB. The total size of the install when extracted (plus HD movies (Pops Maellard's version) in 1920x1080 resolution) is approximately 35GB. Please bear this in mind if you intend to keep backups and/or are operating on a system with limited available memory.

## Optional Install Assistant - Quicker TSLPatching

Because of the way KOTOR mods install, it's virtually impossible to have a true mod manager/installer hybrid like those you may be familiar with for other games, like MO2 or FOMM. The best we can really get are tools to accelerate installations, of which one is supported for the mod builds.

### Quicker TSLPatching

[**Quicker TSLPatching**](https://www.nexusmods.com/kotor/mods/1214?tab=description) is a system workaround (specifically a registry edit) which makes it easier to install mods. This script *will not work* on Mac operating systems (neither Linux, I believe) not running Windows on a partition, but there are some comments in the Posts section of the download page that might offer alternatives that allow it to function properly.

This mod features no level of automation, and only serves to speed up the install process of mods installed via the TSLPatcher executable. Mods will frequently use the TSLPatcher to install, and the TSLPatcher often requires you to manually point the installer at your game's base installation directory. Sometimes the patchers do this automatically, but sometimes they fail, which is where this script comes in; it'll create a symlink to your KOTOR and KOTOR 2 install directories direct to your desktop, where the TSLPatcher defaults to pointing, so you only need to scroll down and click the folder to install without navigating through your system's file structure to find the game folder. The script is confirmed safe and once your install is complete you can delete the desktop folders with no problems. To install, you only need to run the script and follow the instructions it presents, choosing your KOTOR directory in the first popup window and your KOTOR 2 directory in the second. If the script does not function for you, check the Posts section of the mod download page to see some alternate suggestions for manually forcing the functionality of the script.

## CRITICAL: PC Version Differences & Fixes

**Your entire install could be unstable if the information in this step is not taken into account**. I hope that's gotten everyone's attention, because it really is that important. This section will be a bit long by necessity, but it is critical.

KOTOR 2 has multiple different versions. The easiest way to refer to these are the Aspyr patch and legacy version. The legacy version is the original release, while the Aspyr patch is a newer update and the default version of the Steam, GoG, and Mac Appstore game copies. It may also be on some more obscure storefronts like the Amazon Games version of KOTOR 2, but we haven't been able to find anyone who owns it there to confirm--if you're ever unsure about which copy you're using, you can boot a freshly-installed copy of the game up with a controller plugged in and see if it responds to controller commands: if it does, you have the patch. If you don't have a controller handy, you can check the resolution options available ingame; if you see 1920x1080 or ultrawide options, you have the patch.

As implied by the above, the Aspyr patch adds some useful functionality like native controller and widescreen support. The patch unfortunately also adds several bugs. Until recently most of these problems were not fixable, though some had workarounds. However, through a series of new tools and patches by J, *all* of the serious problems caused by the Aspyr patch can now be fixed. The only significant issues of note that remain are:

1. The possibility of losing savegames (this can be entirely avoided just by turning off cloud saves)
2. What can best be described as "dialogue floatiness". Sometimes the dialogue will just... skip, for no good reason. This is different than memory leak-related dialogue skipping, if you're familiar with that in the context of KOTOR. It's more like delayed input reading, where one mouse press to bypass a dialogue line will register as two and instantly skip the next dialogue as well. This is a really annoying bug, but thankfully is fairly rare.
3. When playing with a controller plugged in, even if not *actually using* the controller, it can cause an issue where the camera becomes vertically offset after upgrading an item in the workbench. Unplugging any controllers while playing resolves the issue entirely, but if you intend to play with a controller the issue must be resolved by saving and loading after it occurs.

All of the above is being brought up now for two important reasons: first, if you're using the Aspyr patch, you *must* apply the fix packages linked further down in this section for this build to function properly. And second, if your game version *isn't* using the Aspyr version, you need to decide whether or not you want it to be.

Unlike the original KOTOR, where the widescreen application is so good that running it actually makes the game *more* stable, the same is very much not true of KOTOR 2. KOTOR 2's widescreen potential through UniWS is constrained to an extremely small number of resolutions, and the UniWS application for KOTOR 2 is extremely outdated, causing gradual save corruption and eventually wrecking the player's ability to load their saves. If that was gobbledygook to you, tl;dr *if you don't use the Aspyr patch, you can't apply widescreen to your game safely*. So even though it has some issues, if you either want widescreen support or to have controller support for your game and are not on GoG/Steam/Mac Appstore, you NEED to apply the Aspyr patch to your game copy. My personal recommendation, having played KOTOR 2 an embarassing 35+ times on the legacy version and a single time on the Aspyr version with J's fixes, is to use the Aspyr version if you can. No, it isn't perfect. But the better stability it affords is well worth the few annoying bugs it creates. If you want to use it, you can install it from the link provided by Tarhiel in [this thread on the GoG forums](https://www.gog.com/forum/star_wars_knights_of_the_old_republic_series/kotor_ii_drmfree_steam_update/post58). We've checked the files and confirmed that they are just a copy of the Aspyr patch: just extract the files and move them directly into your KOTOR 2 game folder, overwriting when prompted, and you will update your install to the Aspyr version.

For those who have the Aspyr patch installed, the below are the fixes which must be applied in order for this build to function normally:

### 3C-FD Patcher

**Name:** [3C-FD Patcher](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2734-fog-fix-more-3c-fd-patcher/)

**Author:** J

**Description:** Actual unadulterated black magic fuckery that fixes a huge number of the persistent and glaring problems of the Aspyr patch.

**Category & Tier:** Bugfix, Graphics Improvement / 1 - Essential

**Installation Method:** Executable

**Compatibility Warning:** If you didn't read the wall of text that preceded this mod, you can brick your entire install here. You'd seriously better not have just skipped straight here.

Ensure to only use this if on the most recent Steam/GoG patch, or if having manually applied the Aspyr patch to your game! Also ensure your executable is a fresh copy with no edits: it CANNOT have a 4GB/Large Address Aware patch already applied to it (this mod adds that patch). Finally, please note that **this mod cannot be utilized on the Mac Appstore version of the game**, since it doesn't launch via an executable; for Mac Appstore players, you will unfortunately need to play without these fixes. Since your games will not have the capacity to use 4GB of RAM, we recommend against utilizing the "Ultimate" series of upscales included later in this install, as a stability measure. Without the upscales, the Mac Appstore version should still be able to run the rest of the build without memory issues.

When attempting to run this executable, Windows/your antivirus might attempt to block it, because it's an unsigned executable. The patch is made by a trusted member of the community, I have used it myself and can vouch for it, and the source code is publicly available [HERE](https://github.com/J0-o/kotormods/tree/main/C3-FD_patcher)--please feel assured that this program is safe, and you can override Windows/your AV and run it. When running 3C-FD, select your game's executable and choose to apply all patches except the borderless windowed patch (this patch is not inherently incompatible with the builds, but because it is currently experimental I recommend not using it).

### Water Restoration

**Name:** [Water Restoration](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2734-fog-fix-more-3c-fd-patcher/)

**Author:** J

**Description:** Restores many of the water effects which were removed with the Aspyr patch.

**Category & Tier:** Bugfix, Graphics Improvement / 1 - Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Known Bugs:** This mod causes some strong light reflections below the grates on Citadel Station, but the mod author is looking into resolving this.

___

### Stutter Fix

**Name:** [Stutter Fix and Force Cage Update](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2699-stutter-fix-and-force-cage-update/)

**Author:** J

**Description:** Inexplicably, Force cages were given certain water texture properties which caused them to generate horrid visual lag whenever the player's camera faced their direction. This simple mod removes this property to resolve the issue, and also optionally enhances the force cage's model and texture

**Category & Tier:** Bugfix, Graphics Improvement / 1 - Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Download Instructions:** Download just forcecage_updated_1.1.0.zip

## Mod List

### 4GB Patcher

**Name:** [4GB Patcher](https://ntcore.com/?page_id=371)

**Author:** Daniel Pistelli

**Description:** This is a program which modifies your game's executable file to be able to utilize up to 4 gigabytes of RAM, since KOTOR is a 32-bit application and by default can only utilize 2 gigabytes. This will help the game run smoothly even with the larger texture throughput this build creates, and also reduces issues caused by a memory leak which is native to the game, preventing crashes and savegame corruption.

**Category & Tier:** Patch / 1 - Essential

**Installation Method:** Executable

**Installation Instructions:**  This step should only be performed if you are **NOT** on the Aspyr patch and have not applied J's 3C-FD patcher! 3C-FD applies this as part of its fixes to the Aspyr version. Just like 3C-FD, since the Mac Appstore version is not an executable, this program cannot be utilized on the Mac Appstore edition of the game.

___

### TSLRCM

**Name:** [The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/578-tsl-restored-content-mod/)

**Author:** zbyl2, DarthStoney, Hassat Hunter & VarsityPuppet

**Description:** The whole reason why you would mod KOTOR 2, the legendary mod that includes bugfixes, restored content, and altered scenes to return the game to what it was meant to be. This mod isn't just essential—it's mandatory.

**Category & Tier:** Bugfix, Immersion, Mechanics Change & Restored Content / 1 - Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** YES, *but* you must install the version of TSLRCM which corresponds to your language of choice.

**Installation Method:** Executable

**Compatibility Warning:** Recall that no version of M4-78 is compatible with this build; do not use it alongside TSLRCM! Remember also that the Workshop version of this or any other mod is NOT to be used!

___

### TSLRCM Tweak Pack

**Name:** [TSLRCM Tweak Pack](http://deadlystream.com/files/file/296-unofficial-tslrcm-tweak-pack/)

**Author:** Pavijan (update by Fair Strides)

**Description:** Reverts and otherwise modifies certain TSLRCM settings to make the game more sensible and internally consistent (mostly unrestoring content which was likely intentionally cut by Obsidian). This includes removing Jedi Padawan Kaevee.

**Masters:** TSLRCM

**Category & Tier:** Patch / 1 - Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** PARTIAL - All components can be installed *except* for Trayus Mandalore Conversation.

**Installation Method:** Multi-Run TSLPatcher

**Installation Instructions:** Don't use the complete installer, instead selecting the individual component installer—this is *critical* for compatibility, not just to choose specific options. The installer for this mod will need to be run 6 times, once to install each of the options we'll be using: Kaevee Removal Parts 1 & 2, Saedhe's Head, Kreia-Atris Dialogue Tweak, Trayus Mandalore Conversation, and Trayus Sith Lord Masks. Most of the other options for this mod are untested with the mod builds, but will likely function--I still recommend against using them, since compatibility isn't 100% guaranteed, but you can try. The one exception is *Atton at the End*, which is completely incompatible with one of the most important mods in this build, which is a much more comprehensive implementation of Atton's dialogue at endgame.

___

### Silent Sion

**Name:** [Silent Sion Restoration](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2426-silent-sion-restoration/)

**Author:** Emperor Devon

**Description:** Another TSLRCM change I am not personally thrilled with—when Sion encounters the Exile for the first time in TSLRCM on the *Harbinger*, he speaks to them a line of warning. That engagement takes so much tension out of the scene, and this mod reverts it to the vanilla standard: when Sion appears at the end of the hall he only slowly walks towards the party, threatening and menacing.

**Masters:** TSLRCM

**Category & Tier:** Immersion / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File

**Installation Instructions:** Move just 153sion.dlg to the override.

___

### Thematic KOTOR 2 Companions

**Name:** [Thematic KOTOR 2 Companions](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2662-thematic-kotor-2-companions/)

**Author:** Sniggles & JCarter426

**Description:** In the original KOTOR, BioWare did a few wacky things with character progression. Obsidian, not wanting to be outdone, decided to be even worse by just straight-up copying the statlines of several KOTOR companions for KOTOR 2 companions!

As part of the Thematic series of mods by JC and myself, Thematic KOTOR 2 Companions is a rework of companion starting attributes, skills, feats and powers to lock all companions into having the exact amount of bonuses they should for their level, as well as retuning several of their setups to more closely match the characters' behaviors and backstories. The goal is to ensure that companions' statlines are not only thematically consistent, but also broadly mechanically balanced, to better-incentivize the use of under-utilized party members.

**Masters:** TSLRCM

**Category & Tier:** Mechanics Change / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** TSLPatcher

**Installation Instructions:** If you would like to have Visas's class as Sith Assassin, install the "Standard + Sith Assassin Visas" option. Otherwise, simply install "Standard."

___

### Saving Throw Fixes

**Name:** [Prestige Class Saving Throw Fixes](http://deadlystream.com/files/file/828-tsl-prestige-class-saving-throw-fixes/)

**Author:** Rovan

**Description:** For some reason, some prestige classes in KOTOR 2 have worse saving throws than their predecessor class. This mod fixes this, ensuring that the more advanced classes always have slightly better throws.

**Category & Tier:** Mechanics Change / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Installation Instructions:** I advise users to only install the Jedi Master/Sith Lord fixes.

___

### Classic Class Attack

**Name:** [Classic Class Attack Bonus](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2812-classic-class-attack-bonus/)

**Author:** Crimson Knight

**Description:** In the original KOTOR, Soldier and Guardian classes had a 1:1 attack bonus; for every one level, they gained +1 attack. For every other class, this ratio was 1.25:1, which made classes feel different ingame and contributed to a difficulty scale. For unknown reasons, KOTOR 2 did away with this differentiation and gave every class a 1:1 ratio. This mod reverts this, giving classes which aren't explicitly melee-focused the 1.25:1 ratio back, restoring a bit of difficulty to what is otherwise a *very* easy game.

**Category & Tier:** Mechanics Change / 1 - Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** TSLPatcher Mod

**Installation Instructions:** Strongly recommend downloading the standard option. Weaker Consulars can be extremely punishing, so if you choose this option be aware that you're in for a rough time at some places!

___

### Robes with Shadows

**Name:** [Robes with Shadows for TSL](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2075-robes-with-shadows-for-tsl/)

**Author:** PapaZinos

**Description:** What use, I ask you, is the Soft Shadows setting ingame if your shadows are still 10 polygons? This mod gives all robes proper shadows that match their models more directly, for that extra touch of realism.

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 3 - Suggested

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Installation Instructions:** Extract the mod. Ignore the included subfolders, and move just the files in the base folder to your override. Overwrite when prompted.

___

### K2CP

**Name:** [K2 Community Patch](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1280-kotor-2-community-patch/)

**Author:** Multiple; A Future Pilot, JCarter426 Curates

**Description:** A community bugfix and general improvement patch for KOTOR 2 meant to be a supplement to TSLRCM, fixing bugs that TSLRCM didn't catch or viewed too minor to address; highly recommended.

**Masters:** TSLRCM

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement & Bugfix / 1 - Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** TSLPatcher Mod

**Installation Instructions:** Remember, warnings during an installation are normal—errors are not.

### Remote Tells Influence

**Name:** [Remote Tells Influence](https://www.gamefront.com/games/knights-of-the-old-republic-ii/file/remote-tells-influence) and [**PATCH**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/af3h6y793f3zjxq/Remote%20Tells%20Influence%20Patch%20for%20TSLRCM.zip?dl=0)

**Author:** tk102, patch by Leilukin

**Description:** This is going to require a bit of an explanation. I personally believe this mod breaks immersion—so why add it? The bottom-line is that KOTOR 2's influence system is asinine, and major plot points are locked behind very high—or very low—influence with several companions. Your influence with companions is also extremely obfuscated, only really discernible by their LS/DS alignment relative to your alignment, but this is a very buggy system which breaks with high Charisma values on the player, or with certain feats. There is no other way ingame to tell what your influence is without this mod. I mark it as optional because it *does* break immersion, but for many players I think having a system to determine influence will be extremely important for enjoyment of the story.

**Category & Tier:** Mechanics Change / 4 - Optional

**Non-English Functionality:** NO

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod & Patch

### Better Czerka Salvager

**Name:** [Fixed / Better Czerka Salvager](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2576-fixed-better-czerka-salvager/)

**Author:** OzilsEyes

**Description:** I'm betting that *anyone* who has played KOTOR 2 before will remember that fucking son of a bitch Czerka salvager in the Telos military base. His pathfinding would make the most awful escort quest target in history blush in embarassment. This mod by Ozils is an outright lifesaver, applying much-enhanced follower logic to the salvager and automatically teleporting him to the party if you get too far away. No more 20 minutes of painstakingly dragging his ass through the base!

**Category & Tier:** Bugfix / 2 - Recommended

### Ultimate HR Textures

**Name:** [Ultimate High Resolution Texture Pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/kotor2/mods/1100)

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 1 - Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Installation Instructions:** Download the .tpc variant of the mod. Delete PER_Gr01.tpc, TEL_rock.tpc through TEL_rock07.tpc, and TEL_wl05.tpc before moving the files to your override folder.

### Ultimate Character Overhaul

**Name:** [Ultimate Character Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/kotor2/mods/1060)

**Author:** ShiningRedHD

**Description:** Ultimate Character Overhaul is a comprehensive AI-upscale of every character and piece of equipment in the game. Unlike previous AI upscales, the Ultimate series has no transparency problems while still retaining reflections on character textures, all without any additional steps required. This is an incredibly high-quality mod, and ShiningRed has even gone through the trouble to make compatibility patches for the mod builds, upscaling some of the later textures we use!

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 1 - Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Installation Instructions:** For now, ignore all patches (those will be installed later). Just download the main package, either Full or Lite based on your quality preferences (I recommend the 2x version, as the graphical differences are minimal). Just **MAKE SURE** they are in .tpc file format! Delete N_OndSoldMH1.tpc, PMBJ02.tpc, PMHC03.tpc, PMHC03D1.tpc, and PMHC03D2.tpc before moving to override.

**Author:** MessesWithWolves

**Description:** Though this mod is for K1, I've tested it with K2 and it not only works, it looks fine even with K2's drastically different atmosphere on Korriban.

**Description:** For those gluttons for punishment among us, this mod reverts the inventory of Dendis Dobo, the honest but struggling merchant on Citadel Station, to its pre-TSLRCM state. In TSLRCM all merchants have improved inventories, but with this mod Dendis has only a pittance of poor goods, to represent the cost of his honesty and exactly how much his business is struggling compared to his brother.

They're all made for the first game, but work just fine when ported into the second; there'll be many mods like this throughout the build.

**Author:** DarthParametric

**Description:** In vanilla, Twi'lek thigh-high boots are painted on the character's texture rather than added to their equipped clothing as an item, which would give them realistic three-dimensional depth and higher resolution. This mod adds the boots as an equipped object, increasing the quality and appearance of the boot textures.

**Author:** Leilukin

**Description:** Most of the Twi'lek textures used in the game are very samey, ultimately boiling down to just a few alternate textures. This mod makes use of alternate textures created as a modder's resource to significantly differentiate the appearances of many unique Twi'lek NPCs.

**Category & Tier:** Appearance Change / 3 - Suggested

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** HoloPatcher Mod

**Name:** [Dahnis Unique Look](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2198-dahnis-unique-look/)

**Author:** Leilukin

**Description:** Female Twi'lek have the same appearance differentiation problem the males do, but unlike the males I find most of the alternate textures out there for females a bit too flashy for my taste. This is a somewhat subdued change more in line with vanilla, but still giving a unique look which makes the NPC Dahnis stand out.

**Description:** Fixes several model errors present due to misnamed animations and misplaced weapon positions.

**Category & Tier:** Bugfix / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Known Bugs:** This mod will cause female models wielding blaster rifles or blaster repeaters to run... well, strangely, with the rifle merged into their torso. This is a known bug which JC is looking to fix, but for now as long as you aren't playing a woman wielding a rifle or repeater, you should never notice it. If you do intend on doing a female rifle-wielder run, skipping this mod is probably for the best.

**Installation Instructions:** Move the files from the override folder to your override directory. Optionally, if you prefer the aesthetic of the K1 running animation, you can also move the files from the 'K1 Style Running' folder to your override and overwrite.

**Description:** In old Legends canon, Mandalore's mask looks nothing at all like what it looks like ingame. This mod is an attempt to rectify this while still keeping the majority of Mandalore's aesthetic intact.

**Author:** J

**Description:** J's mod here is some more black magic fuckery, finding out a way to make lightsaber "textures" (of a sort) apply both on the legacy patch and Aspyr patch versions of the game, when they were previously broken on the latter. What's more, he's made this mod compatible with JC's lightsaber visual effects above, and also added Crazy34's lightsaber reflections to his sabers, so your (and enemy!) lightsabers will dynamically reflect off of nearby surfaces. The model differentiations here aren't groundbreaking, but they're better than vanilla where all the sabers are entirely the same, especially when you see just how great the reflections look ingame.

### HD Terminal Texture

**Name:** [Terminal Texture](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1925-terminal-texture/)

**Description:** This mod significantly improves and animates the computer panel texture. Although it's listed for KOTOR, it also works in KOTOR 2.

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Installation Instructions:** The files in this mod need to be duplicated and those duplicates renamed. On a Windows OS you can do this by copying the two files within and pasting them into the same folder which you copied them from. This should create duplicates of the original files with a slightly different filename (such as PLC_CompPnl-COPY). Take the two copied files and rename them to PLC_CompPnl_b. Make sure you have one .tga filetype and one .txi filetype. When the files are moved to the override, you should be moving four files: PLC_CompPnl.tga, PLC_CompPnl.txi, PLC_CompPnl_b.tga, and PLC_CompPnl_b.txi

**Description:** Dramatically improves the quality of every single skybox in the game—one of the more impressive graphics mods ever released.

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** TSLPatcher Mod

**Download Instructions:** Download just the main file (HQSkyboxesII_TSL.7z or HQSkyboxesII_TSL_1k.7z), not any of the compatches. Whether you use the 1k version is your choice or not; on older systems, the 1k version will give better performance.

**Installation Instructions:** After this mod has finished installing, if you are using the K2CP, extract the K2CP once again—*do not* re-run its TSLPatcher! Open the TSLPatchdata folder and move 231teld.mdl and 231teld.mdx to your override, and overwrite when prompted.

**Description:** By default the Ebon Hawk's cockpit is opaque when seen from outside the ship. This mod fixes that, letting you see into the cockpit from the outside.

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 3 - Suggested

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** TSLPatcher Mod

**Download Instructions:** I recommend the reskin-friendly version; the reflectivity version is untested with the builds and may look odd.

**Installation Instructions:** Apply the main installation, then go into the Compatibility Patches folder and apply any of the following you use in this order: K2CP ("K2CP and_or Nar Shaddaa Landing Pad Repair by PapaZinos"), "High Quality Skyboxes II by Kexikus" (but *NOT* the 'M4-78 with HQ Skyboxes II' folder!), and "Spark Effect - Ebon Hawk by PapaZinos". **DO NOT USE** the content of the "Korriban Distorted Model Fix" folder, even if you are on the Aspyr patch! With the C3-FD patcher, this is no longer a concern.

### HD Cockpit Skyboxes

**Name:** [HD Cockpit Skyboxes](http://deadlystream.com/files/file/931-hd-cockpit-skyboxes/)

**Author:** tjsase

**Description:** Vastly improves the quality of exterior areas as viewed from the cockpit of the Ebon Hawk.

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Download Instructions:** Download the version of the mod you would like based upon how detailed you want the cockpit skyboxes to appear. Keep in mind that load time into the Ebon Hawk could be significantly increased if using very large cockpit textures, and there's also a risk of save corruption when using very large texture sizes—I recommend the Medium texture option for the best balance of quality and size/performance. Whatever size you decide to use, make sure to use the .tpc format files!

**Installation Instructions:** Move the loose files to the override, followed by the file in the "With Nar Realistic Skybox" folder if you use HQ Skyboxes II.

### Short-Term Memory Fix

**Name:** [Vaklu Short-Term Memory Fix](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2654-vaklu-short-term-memory-fix/)

**Author:** SuperChameau

**Description:** In your dialogue with Vaklu when supporting him as your candidate for the Onderon throne, he virtually repeats himself verbatim in two sentences back-to-back. I see some grey on those temples man, but it's a bit too early for dementia. This mod tweaks his dialogue so he says something meaningfully different. This change is fully voiced using original voice work thanks to dialogue splicing.

### Thorium Charge Mod

**Name:** [Thorium Charge Mod](http://deadlystream.com/files/file/147-thorium-charge-mod/)

**Author:** darth_gil

**Description:** Thorium charges are used to blow open heavily-fortified rooms, of which there are two in the game. There are also two thorium charges in the vanilla game—*however*. One of them is hidden behind completing a quest and then re-checking the merchant Akkere's inventory (which you are never informed has updated), *and* Akkere can die during the fighting on Dantooine. I recommend using this mod, which adds a thorium charge on Dxun (where it most logically would be), just to save a little bit of hassle.

**Description:** At the end of the game, the lightsabers Kreia attacks you with are purple, and also treated ingame as organic—that is, not immune to fear, paralysis or stun. This mod makes them immune to those statuses and also makes them red—logically, red is what Kreia would've had on hand.

### Kreia's Fall Cutscene

**Name:** [Kreia's Fall Ingame Cutscene](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1228-kreias-fall-cutscene-in-game/)

**Author:** danil-ch

**Description:** Improves the quality of the cutscene which reveals Kreia's casting out of the Triumvirate by rendering it in-game rather than as a low-quality movie. Even if you intend to use the High-Resolution Cutscenes mod included under the extended widescreen support section at the bottom of this list, I still recommend this mod; they function basically the same, but by using this mod the characters in the cutscene will use their new textures if any are applied, thereby making it more immersive and further increasing its quality above that of the pre-recorded cutscene, which relies on vanilla textures.

### PartySwap

**Name:** [PartySwap](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/544-partyswap/)

**Author:** DarthTyren & Leilukin

**Description:** PartySwap is a legendary mod, and one of the best ever made for KOTOR 2. Through some unobtrusive scripting magic, it allows you to bring both the Disciple and Handmaiden with you as companions simultaneously, without removing another companion from the party wheel. You can experience all their content and use them both throughout the entire campaign, as was originally intended by Obsidian.

Be aware, however, that PartySwap *does* require some fourth wall-breaking elements, including the need to use a script and dialogue window to summon the Handmaiden in order for its party trickery to work. I don't like this any more than you probably do, but I still think having both the Handmaiden and Disciple is far superior to having only one of them, and I think it's an acceptable price for what the mod provides.

The mod gives you a stim to manage the Handmaiden and Disciple (spawning & despawning them) which you use to run the script. This stim appears in the *shields* quickbar at the bottom-left of the screen, however; be aware of this, since it doesn't show up in the normal stims category!

**Masters:** TSLRCM

**Masters:** TSLRCM

**Non-English Functionality:** English and Russian ONLY

**Installation Method:** TSLPatcher Mod

### PartySwap-EE Compatch

**Name:** [PartySwap/Extended Enclave Compatch](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1304-partyswap-and-extended-enclave-compatibility-patch/)

**Author:** Leilukin

**Description:** PartySwap and Extended Enclave are both large mods that modify many of the same files, so they don't play well together natively. Thankfully, this compatch fixes all those issues and makes them completely compatible.

**Masters:** PartySwap + Extended Enclave

**Author:** Leilukin

**Description:** A mod made at my request by Leilukin, for which I'm very grateful! Originally, even if you play the short prologue on the Ebon Hawk, you're not able to keep your items from that sequence, even though none of them are overpowered or unreasonable for that stage of the game. This mod gives them back to you, so long as T3 is able to breach the door to the security room in the hanger.

### No Health Regeneration

**Name:** [No Health Regeneration](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2530-no-health-regeneration/)

**Author:** offthegridmorty

**Description:** Having health regen by default in KOTOR 2 is bad for many reasons: it makes an already easy game easier; it negates the benefit of the health regeneration feat they added; and it makes the use & crafting of medkits and other health-restoring tools much less useful. I played with this mod and the game was still pretty easy by the end, but it was WAY more fun early on. It made me have to worry about health and especially healing items for quite a bit more time, which preserved the challenge beyond Telos.

### Thematic Sith Lords

**Name:** [Thematic Sith Lords](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1535-thematic-sith-lords/)

**Author:** Sniggles & JCarter426

**Description:** The results of my first foray into KOTOR modding. Everybody knows that the Sith Lords in KOTOR 2 are disappointing as bosses—the goal of this mod is to make them thematically unique, so that fights against them are fun and that certain character builds excel at fighting some Lords and struggle against others.

**Masters:** TSLRCM

**Category & Tier:** Mechanics Change / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** TSLPatcher Mod

**Installation Instructions:** First choose your base install option, either Standard or No Force Rating (the latter removes the inherent DS alignment bonus to saves in some modules, which also gives an equivalent malus to LS characters in those modules). After this is installed, if you would like for Visas to ambush you as a Sith Assassin (which is a *very difficult fight*—remember, she will have Sneak Attack, and that fight forcibly stuns you), re-run the patcher and also install that option.

___

### Thematic Jedi Masters

**Name:** [Thematic Jedi Masters](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2633-thematic-jedi-masters/)

**Author:** Sniggles & JCarter426

**Description:** The much younger brother of Thematic Sith Lords, Thematic Jedi Masters was born of me discovering that all of the Masters except Atris have the same class (Guardian), and one doesn't even have any Force Points for your encounter! These fights were extremely half-baked, and that's where this mod comes in. Unlike Thematic Sith Lords the design philosophy was not of a rock-paper-scissors style (so you aren't going to find a tremendous glaring weakness with a Master as you might on a Lord) but rather to accentuate a given master's strengths in line with their respective natures.

**Name:** [Better Disciple Meditation](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2612-better-disciple-meditation/)

**Author:** offthegridmorty

**Description:** Let's be honest, Disciple kinda sucks. This mod makes him suck *marginally* less by making his meditation ability actually useful, so you might have some incentive to take him around with you at least some of the time, or bring him out to re-apply his meditation bonus.

**Author:** Effix

**Description:** Bao-Dur gets more than a little screwed. He can't wear robes because they never made a model for them with his mechanical arm cutout, and he can't wear heavy armor because they didn't make a model for that, either. Especially with his stat distribution in mind, that makes him kind of garbage. This mod restores the ability to give him heavy armor, at least, which gives him at least a bit better utility.

**Author:** JCarter426

**Description:** For being a crystal which is specifically attuned to the player, your little pet rock wasn't very malleable. This mod adds a ton of different alignment levels for your player crystal based upon your alignment and class, fixes several bugs with the crystal, and also allows the player to attune the crystal at workbenches when Kreia isn't available.

**Author:** N-DReW25

**Description:** The Jekk'Jekk'Tarr sequence in the vanilla game, and even in TSLRCM, has a lot of problems. The most glaring was the player's ability to enter the bar without suffering severe ill-effects, even though dialogue elsewhere suggested that even skin contact would be nearly instantly fatal. This mod resolves almost all of the idiosyncracies of the sequence in a very lore-friendly and logical way.

**Name:** [Mira's Vanilla Escape for TSLRCM](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2671-miras-vanilla-escape-for-tslrcm/)

**Author:** WildKarrde

**Description:** TSLRCM edits the scene with Mira escaping the tunnels beneath the Jekk'Jekk'Tarr, restoring one scene but, in the process, removing another. This mod restores the vanilla sequence while also keeping the dialogue restored by TSLRCM, and even adding in a few lines unrestored by TSLRCM in the process.

### Harbinger Performance Fix

**Name:** [Harbinger Arrival Performance Enhancement](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2027-harbingers-arrival-performance-enhancement-for-tslrcm/)

**Author:** PapaZinos

**Description:** The *Harbinger* cutscene sequence is absolutely the most ambitious cutscene the game ever attempts. With multiple module loads, split .bik movie cutscenes, panning and circling cameras, the arrival of the *Harbinger* is one of the most impressive visual sequences in the entire game, at least from a technical perspective. But my god, the engine does not like it. This mod tightens everything to do with the sequence up and makes the entire thing much more stable, less prone to crashes or forced minimizations on modern hardware.

**Name:** [Darth Sion and the Male Exile](http://deadlystream.com/files/file/996-darth-sion-and-male-exile-mod/)

**Author:** Leilukin

**Description:** I find that Sion's character comes off completely one-dimensional, ruining both his own interesting character arc and his relationship with Kreia, unless he can express a feeling of sentimentality for the Exile. Unfortunately this is conveyed via a romantic obsession between Sion and the player, and by default this is locked to a female Exile. In the interests of presenting Sion at his best as a character, this mod causes Sion to become obsessed with the player regardless of their gender.

### Assassins with Lightsabers

**Name:** [Sith Assassins with Lightsabers](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2631-sith-assassins-with-lightsabers/)

**Author:** Lewok2007

**Description:** Replaces the Sith Assassins' default weaponry with lightsabers. It makes more sense that they would hunt the last of the Jedi with weapons meant to face them.

Be ready for a hard slog through the *Harbinger* if you choose to use this mod.

### True Sith Assassins

**Name:** [True Sith Assassins](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2649-true-sith-assassins-awareness-restoration/)

**Author:** offthegridmorty

**Description:** By default, Sith Assassins aren't *actually* using stealth, and you don't *actually* roll Awareness to detect them. This mod not only gives the Sith Assassins some levels of Sneak Attack (they are literally stealthed assassins, after all) it also makes them actually use stealth just like the player would, and the party either needs to damage them or roll a successful Awareness check to detect them. As you may expect, this mod can be *hard* depending upon your character build, and also whether you're using Sith Assassins with Lightsabers. It does have an option to reduce the difficulty, though, which makes it more immersive and less about you getting your shit kicked in, if that's appealing to you.

**Category & Tier:** Mechanics Change & Immersion / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Multi-Run HoloPatcher

**Installation Instructions:** Unless you intend on playing a character with very high awareness, I recommend the reduced difficulty option if using Lewok's Sith Assassins with Lightsabers, because the damage will be ridiculous. Remember to also apply the compatch for Lewok's mod after running the main install option of your choice, if using it.

___

### For Mandalore!

**Name:** [For Mandalore!](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2666-for-mandalore/)

**Author:** offthegridmorty

**Description:** Sensed a pattern with Morty and continually putting out banger mods yet? This is a neat one which gives the player the ability to summon Mandalorian reinforcements to support them. Normally this would be too overpowered and kind of out-of-place, but at my request Morty has graciously made an install option specifically for use in the mod builds which only adds the Mandalorian support squads to the *Ravager*, where it makes sense for them to be present and available to come assist the player.

### Peragus Medical Bay Enhancement

**Name:** [Peragus Medical Bay Enhancement](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2513-peragus-medical-bay-enhancement/)

**Author:** WildKarrde

**Description:** A really neat mod which makes the Peragus medical bay a little bit more coherent—you and the miners are no longer expected to breathe bacta gel, for instance. A small mod on balance, but one of my favorites.

**Category & Tier:** Immersion / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** TSLPatcher

**Installation Instructions:** When installing, for best internal consistency choose install options 1 or 2 (not underwear). Option 2 is technically the most consistent but the visual differentiation is very slight and likely would not be noticeable. When the install is completed, if you would like the miners to have burned skin (as they realistically would have had) move the files from the "OPTION - Burned Skin Textures" folder (or the upscaled textures therein) to your override.

### Droid Model Fix

**Name:** [Droid Models Animation Fix](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2748-droid-models-animation-fix/)

**Author:** CaptainSpoque

**Description:** By default there are several droid NPCs in both KOTOR games which have no animations set for them to dodge, which causes them to just sort of freeze whenever the player attacks them but doesn't land a hit. I've noticed this for years and never realized what it was, but Spoque has put together a package here that adds the dodges to the droid models and fixes them freezing mid-fight.

**Category & Tier:** Bugfix / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Known Bugs:** This mod breaks some death animations (droids stand straight up after death, for example). I only found this happening to a single droid, though, so I believe the fixes this mod provides outweighs the bugs, which have already been reported and hopefully will soon be fixed.

**Installation Instructions:** Move all the various files inside the 7 folders within the "TSL Version" folder, EXCEPT for "War Droid K1," if using HQ Blasters above.

___

### Quarterstaff Replacements

**Name:** [Quarterstaff Replacement Pack](http://deadlystream.com/files/file/218-quarterstaff-replacement-pack/)

### Upscaled Icon Overhaul

**Name:** [AI Upscaled Icon Overhaul](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1536-tsl-ai-upscaled-icon-overhaul/)

**Author:** Pramod Marlon

**Description:** This mod uses AI upscaling to increase the resolution and quality of all of the over *one thousand* icons in the game, from Force powers to Feats to gear and lightsaber crystals. It does a wonderful job of it, and I only have one complaint—very small icons, such as when selecting items, can look a little pixelated because the resolution of the new icons is actually too large for downscaling to display them properly. In most of the normal situation where you would be seeing an icon, though, you won't notice that.

**Name:** [Rescaled Trandoshans](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/946-re-scaled-trandoshans/)

### Visually Repair HK

**Name:** [Visually Repair HK-47](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1434-visually-repair-hk-47/)

**Author:** Kexikus

**Description:** This mod brings to KOTOR 2 the same concept that the original game had with repairing HK. In addition to moderately increasing HK's stats over the course of the repairs (a much-welcome improvement, as droids in KOTOR 2 tend to underperform anyway), this mod also allows you to visually see HK become his old self again as the HK-50 components are gradually integrated, fixed and painted-over. The mod even includes some excellent reskins of the HK-50s and -51s! **AND** it's fully-voiced in a seamless way using original game dialogue! You'll have to forgive me, this is like a wet dream for me, seriously.

### Expanded Ending

**Name:** [TSL Expanded Ending](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2672-tsl-expanded-ending/)

**Author:** WildKarrde

**Description:** Congrats, you are about to experience one of the best mods ever made for KOTOR, and I don't say that lightly. WildKarrde has quietly but consistently put out extremely high-quality content, but they really outdid themselves with this one. This is a comprehensive and *incredibly* professional rework of the ending sequence of KOTOR 2. TSLRCM is famous for tightening the ending up, but it still leaves several plot holes flapping in the wind--how does Malachor get destroyed in an LS ending if HK-47 is never rebuilt and G0-T0 isn't stopped? Why does the Exile have to preserve Malachor if they're DS? How is the party saved? What next? None of these questions are answered, but WildKarrde's mod not only answers them all, it does it with an incredible level of professionalism which makes it feel like it was content straight-up made by Obsidian, on a level more seamless than even restored content from TSLRCM often achieves.

**Installation Instructions:** If you are NOT playing the game on a 4:3 aspect ratio monitor, regardless of what your aspect ratio is, install the 16:9 main install option.

___

### Consistent Bastila Recognition

**Name:** [Consistent Bastila Recognition](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2695-consistent-bastila-recognition/)

**Author:** Leilukin

**Description:** The player sees Bastila twice in KOTOR 2: once in a holo-recording left in T3's memory banks, and once in a vision from the Tomb of Ludo Kressh. The problem is that the player recognizes Bastila in Kressh's tomb, but not in the holo-recording. There's no reason why this should be, and this mod fixes the discrepancy: the player now recognizes Bastila in T3's recording also.

**Author:** Fair Strides, patch by JCarter426

**Description:** The Handmaiden has an inhumanly thin waist and scrawny arms by default. This mod fixes both as best it can, leaving her appearing more realistic and giving her at least some indication of upper arm strength.

**Name:** [JC's Handmaiden Sisters](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/810-jcs-handmaiden-sisters/)

**Author:** JCarter426

**Description:** By default, KOTOR 2 has all the handmaidens look exactly the same, except for Brianna herself. This mod restores the original intended appearance of the other sisters, so it actually makes sense when they say that Brianna honors the face of her mother.

### Vibrocutter Changes

**Name:** [Vibrocutter Changes](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2670-vibrocutter-changes/)

**Author:** Lewok2007

**Description:** This is just a thing what bothers me, from a game design perspective. Why would you get a weapon and then get another weapon immediately after, *before* facing any enemies with the first weapon? This mod moves the vibrocutter outside the Peragus medical wing to the body of one of the active droids on the route to the security room, forcing the player to either use the plasma torch or hand-to-hand combat to fight the droids for at least one room.

**Category & Tier:** Immersion / 4 - Option

**Non-English Functionality:** YES, however some text will be in English

**Installation Method:** HoloPatcher Mod

**Name:** [Fixed Hologram Models & Admiralty Redux](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1201-fixed-hologram-models-and-admiralty-redux-for-tslrcm/)

**Author:** DarthParametric

**Description:** By default the hologram models in TSL are essentially just character models with a transparency effect, which means you can see their models' eye sockets and other internal features through the hologram filter. This mod fixes all these model errors that it can, while also bringing back the Admiralty mod of yore, which reskins Carth and Cede to properly wear Republic officer uniforms in their holograms and in-game appearances.

### Companion Clothes

**Name:** [Companion Starting Armors](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2145-k2-companion-starting-armors/)

**Author:** Ol' Cappy

**Description:** Giving companions a unique version of their default clothes so they can keep their 'standard' look throughout the entire game while still having mechanically powerful equipment is a very common mod type. I typically don't like these mods, not because I disagree with the premise but because I tend to balk at +10 WIS modifiers on starting gear. Ol' Cappy, in my opinion, does it right here—these are unique clothes for most of the human companions which don't give insane bonuses, but instead small, rational, and most importantly balanced, lore-friendly and internally-consistent bonuses. These items are never going to be the best your team can get, but they are flavorful additions which will let you keep them in their default get a bit longer, if you so choose.

### Improved Enlightenment/Corruption

**Name:** [Improved LS Enlightenment & DS Corruption Feats](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2577-improved-ls-enlightenment-ds-corruption-feats/)

**Author:** offthegridmorty

**Description:** Light Side Enlightenment (not to be confused with the Force power Enlightenment) and Dark Side Corruption, the bonus feats given to Jedi Master and Sith Lord prestige classes, are really bad. Not only do they only impact a companion's alignment (which is rarely of use to the player), they are also buggy and can overflow, flinging the companion to the complete opposite alignment than they should be! They basically only exist to make things worse. This mod by Morty gives those feats a clear niche: now, instead of impacting companions' alignment directly, it impacts it indirectly by tripling the effects of any influence gain or loss.

**Description:** Because logically it should, right? Force abilities aren't magical... well, okay, they sort of are, but you know what I mean; their strength and finesse are dependent upon the skill and knowledge of the person using them. It makes sense that a Jedi who is very knowledgable about droids would know exactly how to disable them.

### Alignment Affects Force Powers

**Name:** [Alignment Affects Force Powers](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2815-alignment-affects-force-powers-tsl/)

**Author:** offthegridmorty

**Description:** Just like its companion mod for KOTOR, this mod is *badass*. Why is it that, if you've fallen to the absolute depth of the Dark Side, you can throw lightning no more powerful than when you were first beginning to fall? Why is it that, as a paragon of the Light, the strength of your connections changes nothing about the power of the Force you can use to defend yourself? Well, now it does. Be an enlightened Jedi with mighty buffs that last an extended duration, or a fierce Sith Lord whose lightnings are easy to cast and mercilessly damaging. But better still, this mod isn't about a power fantasy—there are consequences that come from aligning strongly with one side, leading to atrophied abilities from the other extreme. It's a well-thought-out design that is well-balanced and feels great ingame while also being logically consistent. In my view, that makes this mod a must-have.

**Category & Tier:** Mechanics Change & Immersion / 1 - Essential

### Remove Duplicate TGA/TPC

**Name:** [Remove Duplicate TGA/TPC](https://www.nexusmods.com/kotor/mods/1384) OR [Bash script for MacOS/Linux](https://pastebin.com/6WCN122S)

**Author:** Flachzangen, bash version by /u/th3w1zard1

**Description:** This is a script written by Flachzangen which allows you to remove duplicate .TGA or .TPC files in your game directory. Files with the .TPC filetype take priority, so for several of the patches we've downloaded which are of the .tga filetype, we need to delete any .TPC duplicates in order to get them to read properly. That's what this script will do. It is **CRITICAL** to use this script, as, if .tpc files take priority in some instances, the game will crash.

**Category & Tier:** Patch / 1 - Essential

**Installation Method:** .bat Patcher

**Installation Instructions:** Place DelDuplicateTGA-TPC (or the bash script version) in your main game folder (NOT override!), run it, say that **TPC should be deleted** and do not manually confirm. If you are on a Mac or other device that cannot run .bat files and the bash script is not an option for you to use, a list of all the files you will need to manually delete can be found [here](/modding/mod_builds/k2/delete.html).

**MAKE SURE THIS SCRIPT RUNS PROPERLY!** On some operating systems, overzealous antivirus setups, or filepaths with particular characters in them it may fail. If the file outputs "Finished, Press any key to continue" but does not list any files it deleted, it *is not working*, and if it does not work it *will* crash your game. You can try to resolve this by moving your Override folder to a different location (I recommend a subfolder in your Documents or Downloads directories), putting the .bat file there and running it through that directory, but if that doesn't work you will need to manually go through and delete the duplicates from the link above.

### Character Textures & Model Fixes

**Name:** [Character Textures & Model Fixes](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2660-4x-upscale-character-textures-model-fixes-tsl/)

**Author:** Redrob41

**Description:** Redrob is a quiet legend within the scene, who disappears for years and pops back up with projects nobody expects but which become instant classics. Welcome to the latest. This mod is an upscale of virtually all NPC textures in the game, including aliens and some creatures. But that's not all—Rob is skilled with texture work, and although this package uses AI as a base, he's gone over it by hand and corrected, adjusted, and in some cases entirely retextured parts of the textures to eliminate hallucinations, burring or fuzziness, and preserve the original aesthetic of the texture. What's more, Rob's forte is modeling, and he's included a huge series of model adjustments and fixes along with this package which fixes various rendering issues. I can't recommend this package highly enough.

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 1 - Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File (with optional automation)

**Download Instructions:** *Strongly* recommend the 2x .tpc version; the fidelity loss for 2x is minimal, .tpc is a lossless conversion and is much slimmer in filesize, and the automated compatibility program for this mod relies on the filetype being .tpc to function.

**Installation Instructions:** If you are on a system which can run .bat files, I *strongly* recommend using the automated system to deal with compatibility for this mod. To do so, first extract redrob's mod from its archive, then enter the "TSL Optional Kreia Model" folder, copy the four model files within, paste them into the "Copy contents to TSL's Override folder" and overwrite. After this, navigate to [this page](https://github.com/KOTOR-Community-Portal/mod-builds/blob/dev/scripts/cleaner.bat) and click on the button with the arrow pointing down at the top of the code list (the one which says "download raw file"). Place cleaner.bat in the folder from redrob's mod called "Copy contents to TSL's Override folder", then go to [here](https://github.com/KOTOR-Community-Portal/mod-builds/blob/dev/scripts/cleanlist_k2.txt) and repeat the same step, placing cleanlist_k2.txt in the same location. You can now run cleanlist.bat: follow the instructions onscreen, selecting whether you did or didn't use any of the given mods, and the batch file will automatically delete the incompatible files. Once you reach the end of the list, you can exit the .bat window, delete cleaner.bat and cleanlist_k1.txt, and then move the remaining files in the folder to your override.

If you cannot run .bat files or feel uncomfortable running this file, you will need to manually delete the files yourself, following the instructions [here](https://github.com/KOTOR-Community-Portal/mod-builds/blob/dev/content/k2/redrob_deletionsk2.md).

Assuming that you are on the Aspyr patch of the game, the following mods can enhance your widescreen gameplay. These mods should *only* be installed if you are on the Aspyr patch; while as previously mentioned widescreen can technically be applied to a legacy KOTOR 2 installation independently of the Aspyr patch it is destabilizing to do so, and strongly recommended against when utilizing this guide.

### Main Menu Fix

**Name:** [Main Menu Fix for Widescreen](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1138-tsl-main-menu-model-fix-for-widescreen/)

**Author:** DarthParametric

**Description:** A fix for TSL's stretched menu when playing the game widescreen.

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement & Bugfix / 3 - Suggested

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Installation Instructions:** Apply the contents of the "for override folder". If you would like to have the TSLRCM version of the KOTOR 2 logo on your main menu, you will need to BOTH move the contents of the "FOR TSLRCM" folder to your override, as well as the contents of the separate download "Updated_TSLRCM_Logo_v1.8.6".

### K2 Cutscenes Rescaled

**Name:** [K2 Cutscenes Rescaled](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2503-k2-cutscenes-rescaled/)

**Author:** Pops Maellard

**Description:** This mod is a *killer* cutscene improvement mod, using a very clean, very sharp AI pass to upscale and clarify the cutscenes.

Unfortunately, there's a price for the quality of Pops's work: the files are extremely hefty, coming in at a whopping 15 gigs. This mod is by far the better of the two cutscene mods available, but if you're on limited data, a poor connection or have limited drive space, it's a much better idea to use naelavok's remastered cutscenes below rather than Pops's version here. If you've got the space and the speed, though, this is where it's at.

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 1 - Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Download Instructions:** Choose the resolution option which most closely fits your monitor's screen size during the download process. If using TSLRCM or Extended Enclave, download both the main file most closely corresponding to your monitor resolution as well as the file of the same resolution with "_mods" appended to the filename (for instance, *k2rs_30fps_1920x1080.7z* and *k2rs_30fps_mods_1920x1080.7z*).

**Installation Instructions:** When installing, there will be several optional files based on how dialogue in cutscenes are displayed (floating text or not, etc). Which of these you choose is your preference; use the mod screenshots to determine. Install the main module first, then open the "mods" version of the file and apply the upscaled cutscenes for any mods which you use from the main build list. Bear in mind that the files from this mod go in your *movies* folder, not override.

If you experience issues with the game minimizing during cutscenes, it might be necessary to go to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7euNu1Tt5E) and following the instructions to use RAD tools to "upscale" the cutscenes to match your exact resolution, though I have not personally attempted this so I don't know how much time it would take to complete. I would estimate around 8 hours, which is the typical time it takes for the native movies to be scaled to 1920x1080 using the same system, but remember that this would be a fully-automated process.

### K2 Remastered Cutscenes

**Name:** [KOTOR 2 Remastered Cutscenes](https://www.nexusmods.com/kotor2/mods/1066/)

**Author:** naelavok 

**Description:** Using predictive AI, /u/naelavok has upscaled the cutscenes for both games out of their horrendous default resolution, to be much more crisp and viewable. A movie replacer like this is necessary to fix the fullscreen bug (plus they're just *really* good), so it's hugely recommended to use it whether you experience issues with fullscreen play or not.

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 1 - Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Components, possible .bat patcher

**Installation Instructions:** Use only Pops Maellard's cutscenes or this version by naelavok. To install, choose the resolution option which most closely fits your monitor's screen size during the download process. Bear in mind that the files from this mod go in your *movies* folder, not override.

### Loading Screen Rescaled

**Name:** [K2 Loading Screen Rescaled](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2622-k2-loading-screen-rescaled/)

**Author:** Pops Maellard

**Description:** If you decide not to use Pops Mallard's cutscene mod above, this mod is a standalone version of their enhanced legal screen (which I personally enjoy) that you can download as a standalone.

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 4 - Optional

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

### Workbench Camera Tweak

**Name:** [Workbench Upgrade Screen Camera Tweak](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1743-workbench-upgrade-screen-camera-tweak-for-tsl/)

**Author:** DarthParametric

**Description:** This mod pulls the camera on the Workbench in closer to show off the textures of what you're editing better. Works best at high resolution and with texture mods, which is why it's listed here in widescreen improvements.

**Category & Tier:** Appearance Change / 3 - Suggested

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

### Upscaled Maps

**Name:** [Upscaled Maps](https://www.nexusmods.com/kotor2/mods/1086)

**Author:** Tunalex

**Description:** This mod upscales every map, including the minimap, to be much more visually clear. Much prettier and also less blurry!

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

## Misc. Basegame Issues & Fixes

### Crash After Character Creation

This is a common issue which users tend to think is caused by the mod builds, but 99.9% of the time you don't have a mod error, and this is a basegame issue. Sometimes the game refuses to load when you have the Frame Buffer Effects setting enabled, so just disabling it in your Advanced Graphics Options ingame will allow you to load the game. This can also get you past loadscreen crashes that may rarely occur later in the game.

### Character Stuck After Combat

This isn't a bug that modding can fix (or cause), it's an engine bug. It's related to the game's framerate being unsynced with your monitor's refresh rate. If you're on a 60hz monitor, you can just toggle v-sync. If you're 144hz or similar, you can either set your monitor to 60hz manually for the duration of play and also toggle v-sync, OR edit the game's .ini file to set the refresh rate setting to your monitor's refresh rate.

### Swoop Racing

Although I don't recommend staying in compatibility mode for Windows XP SP3 long-term, as it can exacerbate loadscreen crashes, sometimes swoop racing can mess up in a way that makes it necessary. If you find your swoop bike floating several meters off the track, exit the game and launch it in compatibility mode for XP SP3. You should be able to race normally, and you can turn off the compatibility mode after the racing segment is over.

### Dialogue Skipping

Dialogue skipping is when an NPC's dialogue line is registered by the game, but jumped past immediately as it's switched to—you briefly see the subtitles, then they're gone with no other indication that character was speaking. I often get asked if this is a build problem, but it's not. The builds exacerbate it in some ways by adding more data to the game (it seems to be related to a memory leak in some way), but the biggest culprit by far is the Aspyr patch, though the issue can happen on any game version. Thankfully, with the 3C-FD patcher, this issue is basically no longer a problem--though bear in mind that it is different from the "dialogue floatiness" I describe in the section on the Aspyr section, and the input delay dialogue skipping with the Aspyr patch still exists. That issue is not related to a memory leak and is not consistent, however, as traditional dialogue skipping is.
