# KOTOR 2 Spoiler-Free Build: Mobile Version

## Installation Instructions

If you were linked to this list directly without reading the install instructions, please go back and read them [here](/modding/mod_builds/index.html). There are some setup and general best-practice steps you need to be aware of before beginning the install process.

### General Instructions

Although this is a mobile-compatible build, due to required compatibility tools we must use to get this build working, you will need to install all mods to a 'dummy directory' on your PC or Mac *first*, then move that completed package over all at once to your phone in order for the builds to apply properly. This means you **MUST** have a PC or Mac in order to utilize this build for mobile, although you **CAN** install just [MTSLRCM](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1801-mobile-restored-content-mod-mtslrcm/) (the mobile version of The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod) with just your mobile device.

It is critical to ensure that you only have **ONE** installation of KOTOR 2 on your device before beginning. If you have multiple installations, or even just two executables in different locations, TSLPatcher executables which are set up to auto-detect your installation directory *will* misidentify which one is correct and install the mods wherever they please, probably spiking your whole install in the process. This is particularly important for installing the mobile builds, as I imagine many users will have a PC version of the game installed on the same computer which they are using to set up the mobile builds! For the sake of stability: if you have a copy of KOTOR 2 installed on your device already, compress it to an archive using a program like WinRAR or 7zip, and delete the loose files left over. Then, when the install process is completed, extract the archive where the previous install was located and your local game will be preserved.

Please also note that the TSLPatcher executable utilized in the installation process of many of these mods (frustratingly) does not function on multi-monitor setups. If you have more than one monitor on the device which you're utilizing the dummy directory on, you will need to disable your second while installing the mods, but you can re-enable it once the installation process is complete.

Do not, under **ANY CIRCUMSTANCES**, run a TSLPatcher or Holopatcher executable from within a file archive. You *must* extract all archives before installing mod content, or running an executable. Failure to extract before installing will break your game. Also, ensure you don't extract all the mods to the exact same folder. If, for example, you extract every single mod to a folder called "KOTOR Mods" and run the executable each time, each time you extract you'll be overwriting critical data from the previous mods. Make sure each installer-based mod is extracted to its own folder before running the installer.

As a final note, please bear in mind: if you are asked to direct a TSLPatcher executable to a folder to begin install, that folder should ALWAYS be your 'dummy directory', the folder which contains the KOTOR 2 editable executable, which you will put together during the TSLRCM installation step. For mods that are NOT installed with the TSLPatcher, *unless otherwise noted* their loose-file contents are most often placed directly in the Override directory. Unless you are following specific instructions (the mod author's or my own) that state otherwise, you should not be placing files directly in the dummy directory. You should *never* have any subfolders inside the Modules or Override folders within the dummy directory.

### Mac OS Users

It is *required* to be able to run executable files in order to install this list. A wrapper program like Wineskin or some other option which will allow you to run executable files is necessary in order to proceed.

### Updating from a Prior Build

If you currently have a prior mod build version installed on your device and would like to update to the current Revision, due to the importance of install order to the mod builds' function, there is unfortunately no way to do so without resetting to a fresh install and reinstalling the new build iteration on top. To do this, you will need to uninstall your game (make sure modded contents are also deleted as part of the uninstall, and if they aren't, delete them manually!) then reinstall the game on your device before reconstructing a new install based off of the updated mobile build Revision and transferring the new mod set to your device, placing it over the freshly-reinstalled game.

## Mod List

### TSLRCM

**Name:** [Mobile TSLRCM (The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod)](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1801-mobile-restored-content-mod-mtslrcm/)

**Author:** zbyl2, DarthStoney, Hassat Hunter & VarsityPuppet

**Description:** The whole reason why you would mod KOTOR 2, the legendary mod that includes bugfixes, restored content, and altered scenes to return the game to what it was meant to be. This mod isn't just essentialâ€”it's mandatory.

**Category & Tier:** Bugfix, Immersion, Mechanics Change & Restored Content / 1 - Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** YES, *but* you must install the version of MTSLRCM which corresponds to your language of choice.

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Installation Instructions:** For now, disregard the installation instructions included in the mod, as we will be dragging over the completed installation in batch. Once the mod is downloaded, extract it to a location of your choice on your PC/Mac and delete everything inside the dlc folder except for the 'mods_*x*' directory, the 'x' corresponding to your language of choice.

You now need to download [this file](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1321-kotor-2-editable-executable/) and place it within your mods_*x* folder. **This file is critical for future installations to function properly**. This is a dummy .exe file which lets later mods install to the right place on your device, and without error. We will delete it as one of the final steps of this installation process, as it's only needed for installations to function normally.

From this point forward all mods are installed as if the mods_*x* folder is the **main game directory**. For any TSLPatcher executable which asks you to select the main game folder/folder with the executable in it, you will select the mods_*x* folder. Similarly, any mods directing you to place their files within the game's override folder will be placed within the override folder within mods_*x*.

### TSLRCM Tweak Pack

**Name:** [TSLRCM Tweak Pack](https://mega.nz/file/oZQTBKDB#tVIzlkuZsO9RT90shcSkhZhOzaD071wmKlNvpNmvwF4)

**Author:** Pavijan (update by Fair Strides)

**Description:** Reverts and otherwise modifies certain TSLRCM settings to make the game more sensible and internally consistent (mostly unrestoring content which was likely intentionally cut by Obsidian, and polishing some other things that don't make sense). Some information has been censored to prevent spoilers.

**Masters:** TSLRCM

**Category & Tier:** Patch / 1 - Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** PARTIAL - All components can be installed *except* for Mandalore Conversation.

**Installation Method:** Multi-Run TSLPatcher

**Installation Instructions:** The installer for this mod will need to be run 7 times, once to install each of the options we'll be using: Kaevee Removal Parts 1 & 2, Saedhe's Head, Atton at the End, Dialogue Tweak, Mandalore Conversation, and Extra 1 - SLM.

___

### Saving Throw Fixes

**Name:** [Prestige Class Saving Throw Fixes](http://deadlystream.com/files/file/828-tsl-prestige-class-saving-throw-fixes/)

**Author:** Rovan

**Description:** In KOTOR 2, the player character can unlock higher mysteries of the Force and achieve a prestige class, which amounts to an upgrade to one of the three default Jedi classes (Guardian, Sentinel, and Consular). For some reason, some prestige classes in KOTOR 2 have worse saving throws than their predecessor class. This mod fixes this, ensuring that the more advanced classes always have slightly better throws.

**Category & Tier:** Mechanics Change / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Installation Instructions:** I advise users to only install the Jedi Master/Sith Lord fixes.

### Robes with Shadows

**Name:** [Robes with Shadows for TSL](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2075-robes-with-shadows-for-tsl/)

**Author:** PapaZinos

**Description:** What use, I ask you, is the Soft Shadows setting ingame if your shadows are still 10 polygons? This mod gives all robes proper shadows that match their models more directly, for that extra touch of realism.

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 3 - Suggested

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod

**Installation Instructions:** Extract the mod. Ignore the included subfolders, and move just the files in the base folder to your override. Overwrite when prompted.

___

### K2CP

**Name:** [K2 Community Patch](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1280-kotor-2-community-patch/)

**Author:** Multiple; A Future Pilot, DarthParametric and JCarter426 Curate

**Description:** A community bugfix and general improvement patch for KOTOR 2 meant to be a supplement to TSLRCM, fixing bugs that TSLRCM didn't catch or viewed too minor to address; highly recommended.

**Masters:** TSLRCM

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement & Bugfix / 1 - Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** TSLPatcher Mod

**SPOILER WARNING**: As a compilation mod, it's impossible to get sufficient permissions to censor this entire mod. DO NOT READ THE README OR MOD WEBPAGE, or spoilers are basically guaranteed. This is a TSLPatcher mod similar to the TSLRCM Tweak Pack (though this one only needs to be run once), so it's a simple install you shouldn't need further instructions for; just do your best to not read any component of it.

**Installation Instructions:** Remember, warnings during an installation are normalâ€”errors are not.

### Remote Tells Influence

**Name:** [Remote Tells Influence](https://www.gamefront.com/games/knights-of-the-old-republic-ii/file/remote-tells-influence) and [**PATCH**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/af3h6y793f3zjxq/Remote%20Tells%20Influence%20Patch%20for%20TSLRCM.zip?dl=0)

**Author:** tk102, patch by Leilukin

**Description:** This is going to require a bit of an explanation. I personally believe this mod breaks immersionâ€”so why add it? In KOTOR 2, companions have [influence](/faq/k2.html#How_does_KOTOR_2's_influence_system_work)â€”a mechanic by which the player character can influence their allies, either to align with their views or grow hostile to them. Sadly, KOTOR 2's influence system is asinine. Major plot points are locked behind very highâ€”or very lowâ€”influence with several companions. Your influence with companions is also extremely obfuscated, only really discernible by a companion's LS/DS alignment relative to your alignment, but this is a very buggy system which breaks with high Charisma values on the player, or with certain feats. There is no other way ingame to tell what your influence is without this mod. I mark it as optional because it *does* break immersion, but for many players I think having a system to determine influence will be extremely important for enjoyment of the story.

### Honest Merchant

**Name:** [Honest Merchant](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1904-honest-merchant-tslrcm/)

**Author:** TK-664

**Description:** For those gluttons for punishment among us, this mod reverts the inventory of an honest but struggling merchant to its pre-TSLRCM state. In TSLRCM all merchants have improved inventories, but with this mod the merchant has only a pittance of poor goods, to represent the cost of his honesty and exactly how much his business is struggling.

**Author:** DarthParametric

**Description:** In vanilla, Twi'lek thigh-high boots are painted on the character's texture rather than added to their equipped clothing as an item, which would give them realistic three-dimensional depth and higher resolution. This mod adds the boots as an equipped object, increasing the quality and appearance of the boot textures.

**Description:** As ever, you're going to be meeting some Mandalorians in KOTOR 2. It's been 10 years since the Mandalorian Wars and the last time the Mandalorians had a state, though, and their suits should reflect that.

### Reflective Lightsaber Blades

**Name:** [New Lightsaber Blade Models](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1847-new_lightsaber_blade_model_tsl/)

**Author:** Crazy34

**Description:** With this mod, Crazy34 walked into the community, slammed down one of the most impressive mods ever made for this game, and dared us to do better. Not only have they split the blade texture in two to allow for lightsabers with cores of a different color (currently unsupported in the build release, but hopefully coming soon), they've also added *dynamic reflections* to each and every lightsaber across almost every area of the game. When you're fighting a Dark Jedi, you're going to see your faces bathed in shifting colors, fading and brightening as you swing your lightsabers; when you ignite your saber in a hallway, it will reflect on the floor and walls, and will realistically increase in intensity as the blade draws nearer to the surface. This is an incredible project, and easily one of the most importantâ€”and impressiveâ€”mods ever released for KOTOR. In the next few years, it could completely change the face of lightsaber modding.

### Exile's Saber Fix

**Name:** [Exile's Saber Fix](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2001-exiles-saber-fix/)

**Author:** N-DReW25

**Description:** One of TSLRCM's restorations adds the bronze color crystal back into the game. There's a dialogue very early on where the player speaks to a companion about what their old lightsaber, which they've since lost, looked like. Curiously, though, despite restoring the bronze crystal option, TSLRCM did not give the player the option to actually say that their original lightsaber had a bronze crystal in this sequence. This mod fixes that.

### Prologue Item Recovery

**Name:** [Prologue Item Recovery](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2211-prologue-item-recovery/)

**Author:** Leilukin

**Description:** A mod made at my request by Leilukin, for which I'm very grateful! KOTOR 2 has a *very* short prologue Ebon Hawkâ€”it's optional, but even if you choose to complete it you don't get to keep any of the items you acquired during that sequence, even though none of them are overpowered for this point of the game. This mod gives them back to you, so long as you're able to sliceâ€”or blowâ€”a security door somewhere on the first planet.

**Description:** The results of my first foray into KOTOR modding. The goal of this mod is to make bosses thematically unique, so that fights against them are fun and that certain character builds excel at fighting some of them and struggle against others.

### Bao-Dur & Heavy Armor

**Name:** [Bao-Dur Can Wear Heavy Armor](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2189-bao-dur-can-wear-heavy-armor/)

**Author:** Effix

**Description:** One of your companions, Bao-Dur, gets more than a little screwed by missing models. He can't wear certain clothing types because Obsidian didn't have time to make a model for him that fit a mechanical arm he has, and he can't wear heavy armor for the same reason. Especially with his stat distribution in mind, that makes him kind of garbage. This mod restores the ability to give him heavy armor, which gives him at least a bit better utility.

**Author:** Leilukin

**Description:** For reasons of story, I find that a certain character comes off completely one-dimensional, ruining his own interesting character arc, unless he can express feelings of sentimentality for the main character. Unfortunately this is conveyed via a romance of sorts, and by default this is locked to a female MC. In the interests of presenting this character at their best, this mod causes the character to become obsessed with the player regardless of their gender. I should stress that this is only included because I find it to be fitting regardless of gender, and hold this character's expression of feelings as plot-relevant.

### VRHK

**Description:** It's difficult to describe this mod without spoiling its contents, but in essence it allows you to progressively upgrade a companion while visually seeing the progress of your repairs, and also provides an improved skin for that companion so the process is even easier to see. To top it all off, the entire sequence is lore-friendly and completely voiced by vanilla companion dialogue. It's an excellent mod.

**Author:** Fair Strides, patch by JCarter426

**Description:** The Handmaiden, a possible companion, originally has an inhumanly thin waist and scrawny arms, the latter of which makes no sense for her character. This mod fixes both as best it can, leaving her appearing more realistic and giving her at least some indication of upper arm strength.

**Author:** DarthParametric

**Description:** By default the hologram models in TSL are essentially just character models with a transparency effect, which means you can see their models' eye sockets and other internal features through the hologram filter. This mod fixes all these model errors that it can, while also bringing back the Admiralty mod of yore, which reskins Admirals that appear in the game to wear Republic uniforms in their holograms and in-game appearances.

### Companion Clothes

**Name:** [Companion Starting Armors](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2145-k2-companion-starting-armors/)

**Author:** Ol' Cappy

**Description:** Giving companions a unique version of their default clothes so they can keep their 'standard' look throughout the entire game while still having mechanically powerful equipment is a very common mod type. I typically don't like these mods, not because I disagree with the premise but because I tend to balk at +10 WIS modifiers on starting gear. Ol' Cappy, in my opinion, does it right hereâ€”these are unique clothes for most of the human companions which don't give insane bonuses, but instead small, rational, and most importantly balanced, lore-friendly and internally-consistent bonuses. These items are never going to be the best your team can get, but they are flavorful additions which will let you keep them in their default get a bit longer, if you so choose.

**Author:** Stoffe

**Description:** The improved AI mod stops in-game characters from using weaker versions of feats (IE Flurry instead of Advanced Flurry), making characters that Obsidian deemed to be harder foes truly more difficult to defeat.

**Category & Tier:** Mechanics Change / 1 - Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** YES

**Installation Method:** TSLPatcher Mod & Loose-File Patch

**Compatibility Warning:** This mod has a minor incompatibility with TSLRCM which causes the player to sometimes be unable to select a third party member during a difficult fight sequence. Utilizing the KOTOR 2 Community Patch fully rectifies this problem.

**Installation Instructions:** The first executable you see is a self-extracting archive; when you find it, just run it and extract to the pre-listed folder (the one the mod is currently in). It will extract the TSLPatcher .exe which you will run as usual to install the mod. When the install is completed, move the patch file into your game's override directory and overwrite.

Do *NOT* use the version for High Level Force Powers; if you were planning on using HLFP, either remove HLFP (recommended) or DO NOT USE Improved AI. There is a compatibility issue when using HLFP and Improved AI together in this build.

### iOS Case Sensitivity Fix

**Name:** [Case Sensitivity Fix](https://github.com/DeadlyStream/KOTORCaseFixer/releases/tag/v1.0) (or Terminal line commands for non-Windows OSesâ€”see below)

**Author:** JCarter426

**Description:** KOTOR on mobile devices has case sensitivity. To make these mods function properly on iOS, the files must be batch-renamed to their case-sensitive versions. This step is **ONLY NEEDED IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE PLAYING ON AN iOS DEVICE**!

**Category & Tier:** Bugfix / 1 - Essential

**Installation Instructions:** Before proceeding, delete the dummy executable used to facilitate the mod installations. If the device you're currently using runs a Windows OS, download one of the executable files from the linked github page matching your operating system's architecture (32-bit or 64-bit; google which your Windows OS is if you're not sure), place the file in the main dummy directory which you have created to install the mods to (NOT the override folder), and run the executable.

If you are on MacOS or Linux, first, run Terminal and navigate to your mods_english directory with the cd command.

`cd [full filepath to mods_english on your device]`

Then, enter the following command:

`find . -depth | xargs -n 1 rename -f 's/(.*)\/([^\/]*)/$1\/\L$2/' {} \;`

If you are prompted for permission, rerun the command with elevated privileges using the sudo command.

`sudo find . -depth | xargs -n 1 rename -f 's/(.*)\/([^\/]*)/$1\/\L$2/' {} \;`

For more information:

* [cd command](https://linuxize.com/post/linux-cd-command/)

* [sudo command](https://linuxize.com/post/sudo-command-in-linux/)

## IMPORTANT: Final Installation Instructions

First, navigate to mods_english's override directory, locate, and delete two files, if they're present: "CM_baremetal.tga" and "CM_baremetal.txi".

Once that's completed, if you did not complete the case sensitivity step, delete the dummy executable file in mods_english which you downloaded at the beginning of the process now. Your install is now complete! You can now connect your mobile device to your system, and move the dlc folder containing the mods_english folder to the install point for your device:

**iOS**:
On iOS, they are placed in iTunes > Apps > Documents, in the same spot that the â€˜savesâ€™ folder goes.

**ANDROID**:
On Android the files should be placed in /Home/Android/data/com.aspyr.swkotor2/files/
