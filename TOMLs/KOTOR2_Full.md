## Mod List

### 4GB Patcher

**Name:** [4GB Patcher](https://ntcore.com/?page_id=371)

**Author:** Daniel Pistelli

**Description:** This is a program which modifies your game's executable file to be able to utilize up to 4 gigabytes of RAM, since KOTOR is a 32-bit application and by default can only utilize 2 gigabytes. This will help the game run smoothly even with the larger texture throughput this build creates, and also reduces issues caused by a memory leak which is native to the game, preventing crashes and savegame corruption.

**Category & Tier:** Patch / 1 - Essential


**Installation Instructions:** This step should only be performed if you are **NOT** on the Aspyr patch and have not applied J's 3C-FD patcher! 3C-FD applies this as part of its fixes to the Aspyr version. Just like 3C-FD, since the Mac Appstore version is not an executable, this program cannot be utilized on the Mac Appstore edition of the game.

### The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod

**Name:** [The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/578-tsl-restored-content-mod/) and [**Patch**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/156EqzmEESrxksm1f0cPl2tMUf-AOUt8Y?usp=sharing)

**Author:** zbyl2, DarthStoney, Hassat Hunter & VarsityPuppet

**Description:** The whole reason why you would mod KOTOR 2, the legendary mod that includes bugfixes, restored content, and altered scenes to return the game to what it was meant to be. This mod isn't just essential—it's mandatory.

**Category & Tier:** Bugfix, Immersion, Mechanics Change & Restored Content / 1 - Essential

### TSLRCM Tweak Pack

**Name:** [TSLRCM Tweak Pack](http://deadlystream.com/files/file/296-unofficial-tslrcm-tweak-pack/)

**Author:** Pavijan (update by Fair Strides)

**Description:** Reverts and otherwise modifies certain TSLRCM settings to make the game more sensible and internally consistent (mostly unrestoring content which was likely intentionally cut by Obsidian). This includes removing Jedi Padawan Kaevee.

**Category & Tier:** Patch / 1 - Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** PARTIAL - Some text will be blank or in English


**Masters:** The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod

**Installation Instructions:** Don't use the complete installer, instead selecting the individual component installer—this is *critical* for compatibility, not just to choose specific options. The installer for this mod will need to be run 6 times, once to install each of the options we'll be using: Kaevee Removal Parts 1 & 2, Saedhe's Head, Kreia-Atris Dialogue Tweak, Trayus Mandalore Conversation, and Trayus Sith Lord Masks. Most of the other options for this mod are untested with the mod builds, but will likely function--I still recommend against using them, since compatibility isn't 100% guaranteed, but you can try. The one exception is *Atton at the End*, which is completely incompatible with one of the most important mods in this build, which is a much more comprehensive implementation of Atton's dialogue at endgame.

### Silent Sion Restoration

**Author:** Emperor Devon

**Description:** Another TSLRCM change I am not personally thrilled with—when Sion encounters the Exile for the first time in TSLRCM on the *Harbinger*, he speaks to them a line of warning. That engagement takes so much tension out of the scene, and this mod reverts it to the vanilla standard: when Sion appears at the end of the hall he only slowly walks towards the party, threatening and menacing.

### Thematic KOTOR 2 Companions

**Name:** [Thematic KOTOR 2 Companions](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2662-thematic-kotor-2-companions/)

**Author:** Sniggles & JCarter426

**Description:** In the original KOTOR, BioWare did a few wacky things with character progression. Obsidian, not wanting to be outdone, decided to be even worse by just straight-up copying the statlines of several KOTOR companions for KOTOR 2 companions!

As part of the Thematic series of mods by JC and myself, Thematic KOTOR 2 Companions is a rework of companion starting attributes, skills, feats and powers to lock all companions into having the exact amount of bonuses they should for their level, as well as retuning several of their setups to more closely match the characters' behaviors and backstories. The goal is to ensure that companions' statlines are not only thematically consistent, but also broadly mechanically balanced, to better-incentivize the use of under-utilized party members.

### Classic Class Attack Bonus

**Name:** [Classic Class Attack Bonus](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2812-classic-class-attack-bonus/)

**Author:** Crimson Knight

**Description:** In the original KOTOR, Soldier and Guardian classes had a 1:1 attack bonus; for every one level, they gained +1 attack. For every other class, this ratio was 1.25:1, which made classes feel different ingame and contributed to a difficulty scale. For unknown reasons, KOTOR 2 did away with this differentiation and gave every class a 1:1 ratio. This mod reverts this, giving classes which aren't explicitly melee-focused the 1.25:1 ratio back, restoring a bit of difficulty to what is otherwise a *very* easy game.

### Remote Tells Influence

**Name:** [Remote Tells Influence](https://www.dropbox.com/s/af3h6y793f3zjxq/Remote%20Tells%20Influence%20Patch%20for%20TSLRCM.zip?dl=0)

**Author:** tk102, patch by Leilukin

**Description:** This is going to require a bit of an explanation. I personally believe this mod breaks immersion—so why add it? The bottom-line is that KOTOR 2's influence system is asinine, and major plot points are locked behind very high—or very low—influence with several companions. Your influence with companions is also extremely obfuscated, only really discernible by their LS/DS alignment relative to your alignment, but this is a very buggy system which breaks with high Charisma values on the player, or with certain feats. There is no other way ingame to tell what your influence is without this mod. I mark it as optional because it *does* break immersion, but for many players I think having a system to determine influence will be extremely important for enjoyment of the story.

**Description:** I'm betting that *anyone* who has played KOTOR 2 before will remember that fucking son of a bitch Czerka salvager in the Telos military base. His pathfinding would make the most awful escort quest target in history blush in embarassment. This mod by Ozils is an outright lifesaver, applying much-enhanced follower logic to the salvager and automatically teleporting him to the party if you get too far away. No more 20 minutes of painstakingly dragging his ass through the base!

**Author:** DarthParametric

**Description:** In vanilla, Twi'lek thigh-high boots are painted on the character's texture rather than added to their equipped clothing as an item, which would give them realistic three-dimensional depth and higher resolution.

**Author:** Leilukin

**Description:** Most of the Twi'lek textures used in the game are very samey, ultimately boiling down to just a few alternate textures. This mod makes use of alternate textures created as a modder's resource to significantly differentiate the appearances of many unique Twi'lek NPCs.

**Description:** Female Twi'lek have the same appearance differentiation problem the males do, but unlike the males I find most of the alternate textures out there for females a bit too flashy for my taste.

**Description:** In old Legends canon, Mandalore's mask looks nothing at all like what it looks like ingame.

**Author:** Dark Hope

**Description:** This mod in particular is super high-quality and one of my favorites.

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES


**Installation Instructions:** Before moving the files to override, make a copy of N_Duros02.tga and paste it into the same location you extracted the mod to. On a Windows OS, this should create a file called N_Duros.tga-COPY. Rename this file to "N_Duros04.tga". Repeat this process with the file N_Duros03, creating two copies and naming them N_Duros05.tga and N_Duros06.tga. When you move all the files to the override, you should be moving eight total. Following this, download and install the patch.

### Enhanced Lightsaber Hilt Variety

**Name:** [Enhanced Lightsaber Hilt Variety](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2794-enhanced-lightsaber-hilt-variety/)

**Author:** J

**Description:** J's mod here is some more black magic fuckery, finding out a way to make lightsaber "textures" (of a sort) apply both on the legacy patch and Aspyr patch versions of the game, when they were previously broken on the latter. What's more, he's made this mod compatible with JC's lightsaber visual effects above, and also added Crazy34's lightsaber reflections to his sabers, so your (and enemy!) lightsabers will dynamically reflect off of nearby surfaces. The model differentiations here aren't groundbreaking, but they're better than vanilla where all the sabers are entirely the same, especially when you see just how great the reflections look ingame.

### Terminal Texture

**Name:** [Terminal Texture](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1925-terminal-texture/)

**Author:** Dark Hope

**Description:** This mod significantly improves and animates the computer panel texture. Although it's listed for KOTOR, it also works in KOTOR 2.

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES


**Installation Instructions:** The files in this mod need to be duplicated and those duplicates renamed. On a Windows OS you can do this by copying the two files within and pasting them into the same folder which you copied them from. This should create duplicates of the original files with a slightly different filename (such as PLC_CompPnl-COPY). Take the two copied files and rename them to PLC_CompPnl_b. Make sure you have one .tga filetype and one .txi filetype. When the files are moved to the override, you should be moving four files: PLC_CompPnl.tga, PLC_CompPnl.txi, PLC_CompPnl_b.tga, and PLC_CompPnl_b.txi

**Installation Instructions:** After this mod has finished installing, if you are using the K2CP, extract the K2CP once again—*do not* re-run its TSLPatcher! Open the TSLPatchdata folder and move 231teld.mdl and 231teld.mdx to your override, and overwrite when prompted.

### Transparent Cockpit Windows TSL

**Name:** [Transparent Cockpit Windows TSL](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2355-transparent-cockpit-windows-for-tsl/)

**Author:** WildKarrde

**Description:** By default the Ebon Hawk's cockpit is opaque when seen from outside the ship. This mod fixes that, letting you see into the cockpit from the outside.

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 3 - Suggested

**Non-English Functionality:** YES


**Download Instructions:** I recommend the reskin-friendly version; the reflectivity version is untested with the builds and may look odd.

**Installation Instructions:** Apply the main installation, then go into the Compatibility Patches folder and apply any of the following you use in this order: K2CP ("K2CP and_or Nar Shaddaa Landing Pad Repair by PapaZinos"), "High Quality Skyboxes II by Kexikus" (but *NOT* the 'M4-78 with HQ Skyboxes II' folder!), and "Spark Effect - Ebon Hawk by PapaZinos". **DO NOT USE** the content of the "Korriban Distorted Model Fix" folder, even if you are on the Aspyr patch! With the C3-FD patcher, this is no longer a concern.

### HD Cockpit Skyboxes

**Name:** [HD Cockpit Skyboxes](http://deadlystream.com/files/file/931-hd-cockpit-skyboxes/)

**Author:** tjsase

**Description:** Vastly improves the quality of exterior areas as viewed from the cockpit of the Ebon Hawk.

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES


**Download Instructions:** Download the version of the mod you would like based upon how detailed you want the cockpit skyboxes to appear. Keep in mind that load time into the Ebon Hawk could be significantly increased if using very large cockpit textures, and there's also a risk of save corruption when using very large texture sizes—I recommend the Medium texture option for the best balance of quality and size/performance. Whatever size you decide to use, make sure to use the .tpc format files!

**Installation Instructions:** Move the loose files to the override, followed by the file in the "With Nar Realistic Skybox" folder if you use HQ Skyboxes II.

### Vaklu Short-Term Memory Fix

**Author:** SuperChameau

**Description:** In your dialogue with Vaklu when supporting him as your candidate for the Onderon throne, he virtually repeats himself verbatim in two sentences back-to-back. I see some grey on those temples man, but it's a bit too early for dementia. This mod tweaks his dialogue so he says something meaningfully different. This change is fully voiced using original voice work thanks to dialogue splicing.

### Thorium Charge Mod

**Name:** [Thorium Charge Mod](http://deadlystream.com/files/file/147-thorium-charge-mod/)

**Author:** darth_gil

**Description:** Thorium charges are used to blow open heavily-fortified rooms, of which there are two in the game. There are also two thorium charges in the vanilla game—*however*. One of them is hidden behind completing a quest and then re-checking the merchant Akkere's inventory (which you are never informed has updated), *and* Akkere can die during the fighting on Dantooine. I recommend using this mod, which adds a thorium charge on Dxun (where it most logically would be), just to save a little bit of hassle.

### Red Floating Lightsabers

**Name:** [Red Floating Lightsabers](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2635-red-floating-lightsabers/)

**Author:** Crimson Knight

**Description:** At the end of the game, the lightsabers Kreia attacks you with are purple, and also treated ingame as organic—that is, not immune to fear, paralysis or stun. This mod makes them immune to those statuses and also makes them red—logically, red is what Kreia would've had on hand.

### Kreia's Fall Ingame Cutscene

**Name:** [Kreia's Fall Ingame Cutscene](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1228-kreias-fall-cutscene-in-game/)

**Author:** danil-ch

**Description:** Improves the quality of the cutscene which reveals Kreia's casting out of the Triumvirate by rendering it in-game rather than as a low-quality movie. Even if you intend to use the High-Resolution Cutscenes mod included under the extended widescreen support section at the bottom of this list, I still recommend this mod; they function basically the same, but by using this mod the characters in the cutscene will use their new textures if any are applied, thereby making it more immersive and further increasing its quality above that of the pre-recorded cutscene, which relies on vanilla textures.

### PartySwap

**Name:** [PartySwap](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/544-partyswap/)

**Author:** DarthTyren & Leilukin

**Description:** PartySwap is a legendary mod, and one of the best ever made for KOTOR 2. Through some unobtrusive scripting magic, it allows you to bring both the Disciple and Handmaiden with you as companions simultaneously, without removing another companion from the party wheel. You can experience all their content and use them both throughout the entire campaign, as was originally intended by Obsidian.

Be aware, however, that PartySwap *does* require some fourth wall-breaking elements, including the need to use a script and dialogue window to summon the Handmaiden in order for its party trickery to work. I don't like this any more than you probably do, but I still think having both the Handmaiden and Disciple is far superior to having only one of them, and I think it's an acceptable price for what the mod provides.

The mod gives you a stim to manage the Handmaiden and Disciple (spawning & despawning them) which you use to run the script. This stim appears in the *shields* quickbar at the bottom-left of the screen, however; be aware of this, since it doesn't show up in the normal stims category!

**Author:** offthegridmorty

**Description:** Having health regen by default in KOTOR 2 is bad for many reasons: it makes an already easy game easier; it negates the benefit of the health regeneration feat they added; and it makes the use & crafting of medkits and other health-restoring tools much less useful. I played with this mod and the game was still pretty easy by the end, but it was WAY more fun early on. It made me have to worry about health and especially healing items for quite a bit more time, which preserved the challenge beyond Telos.

After this is installed, if you would like for Visas to ambush you as a Sith Assassin (which is a *very difficult fight*—remember, she will have Sneak Attack, and that fight forcibly stuns you), re-run the patcher and also install that option.

### Thematic Jedi Masters

**Name:** [Thematic Jedi Masters](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2633-thematic-jedi-masters/)

**Author:** Sniggles & JCarter426

**Description:** The much younger brother of Thematic Sith Lords, Thematic Jedi Masters was born of me discovering that all of the Masters except Atris have the same class (Guardian), and one doesn't even have any Force Points for your encounter! These fights were extremely half-baked, and that's where this mod comes in. Unlike Thematic Sith Lords the design philosophy was not of a rock-paper-scissors style (so you aren't going to find a tremendous glaring weakness with a Master as you might on a Lord) but rather to accentuate a given master's strengths in line with their respective natures.

**Name:** [Better Disciple Meditation](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2612-better-disciple-meditation/)

**Author:** offthegridmorty

**Description:** Let's be honest, Disciple kinda sucks. This mod makes him suck *marginally* less by making his meditation ability actually useful, so you might have some incentive to take him around with you at least some of the time, or bring him out to re-apply his meditation bonus.

### Bao-Dur Can Wear Heavy Armor

**Name:** [Bao-Dur Can Wear Heavy Armor](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2189-bao-dur-can-wear-heavy-armor/)

**Author:** Effix

**Description:** Bao-Dur gets more than a little screwed. He can't wear robes because they never made a model for them with his mechanical arm cutout, and he can't wear heavy armor because they didn't make a model for that, either. Especially with his stat distribution in mind, that makes him kind of garbage. This mod restores the ability to give him heavy armor, at least, which gives him at least a bit better utility.

### JC's Crystal Attunement

**Name:** [JC's Crystal Attunement](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2269-jcs-crystal-attunement-for-k2/)

**Author:** JCarter426

**Description:** For being a crystal which is specifically attuned to the player, your little pet rock wasn't very malleable. This mod adds a ton of different alignment levels for your player crystal based upon your alignment and class, fixes several bugs with the crystal, and also allows the player to attune the crystal at workbenches when Kreia isn't available.

**Non-English Functionality:** NO


**Installation Instructions:** Practically speaking there are only two relevant install options: "Class-Based Properties + Workbench Attunement", which is the full package, or "Bug Fixes Only".

### Better Jekk'Jekk'Tarr Thugs

**Name:** [Better Jekk'Jekk'Tarr Thugs](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2684-better-jekkjekk-tarr-thugs/)

**Author:** SuperChameau

**Description:** The thugs in the Jekk'Jekk'Tarr, despite many of them being bounty hunters in a seedy bar, for the most part didn't carry any weapons at all. This mod fixes that, giving the patrons weapons with which to defend themselves.

**Author:** N-DReW25

**Description:** The Jekk'Jekk'Tarr sequence in the vanilla game, and even in TSLRCM, has a lot of problems. The most glaring was the player's ability to enter the bar without suffering severe ill-effects, even though dialogue elsewhere suggested that even skin contact would be nearly instantly fatal. This mod resolves almost all of the idiosyncracies of the sequence in a very lore-friendly and logical way.

**Name:** [Mira's Vanilla Escape for TSLRCM](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2671-miras-vanilla-escape-for-tslrcm/)

**Author:** WildKarrde

**Description:** TSLRCM edits the scene with Mira escaping the tunnels beneath the Jekk'Jekk'Tarr, restoring one scene but, in the process, removing another. This mod restores the vanilla sequence while also keeping the dialogue restored by TSLRCM, and even adding in a few lines unrestored by TSLRCM in the process.

**Name:** [Kreia's Lightsaber/Longsword](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1538-kreias-lightsaber-long-sword/)

**Author:** bead-v

**Description:** This mod fixes the sequence where Kreia is confronted with Sion on the *Harbinger* so that Kreia doesn't just pull a vibroblade out of nowhere. Instead, she reaches down and picks up a longsword from the nearby corpse of a Republic soldier, more sensibly.

### Harbinger Arrival Performance Enhancement

**Name:** [Harbinger Arrival Performance Enhancement](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2027-harbingers-arrival-performance-enhancement-for-tslrcm/)

**Author:** PapaZinos

**Description:** The *Harbinger* cutscene sequence is absolutely the most ambitious cutscene the game ever attempts. With multiple module loads, split .bik movie cutscenes, panning and circling cameras, the arrival of the *Harbinger* is one of the most impressive visual sequences in the entire game, at least from a technical perspective. But my god, the engine does not like it. This mod tightens everything to do with the sequence up and makes the entire thing much more stable, less prone to crashes or forced minimizations on modern hardware.

### Darth Sion and the Male Exile

**Author:** Leilukin

**Description:** I find that Sion's character comes off completely one-dimensional, ruining both his own interesting character arc and his relationship with Kreia, unless he can express a feeling of sentimentality for the Exile. Unfortunately this is conveyed via a romantic obsession between Sion and the player, and by default this is locked to a female Exile. In the interests of presenting Sion at his best as a character, this mod causes Sion to become obsessed with the player regardless of their gender.

**Name:** [True Sith Assassins](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2649-true-sith-assassins-awareness-restoration/) and [**Patch**](http://deadlystream.com/files/file/195-peragus-sith-troops-to-sith-assassins/)

**Author:** offthegridmorty

**Description:** By default, Sith Assassins aren't *actually* using stealth, and you don't *actually* roll Awareness to detect them. This mod not only gives the Sith Assassins some levels of Sneak Attack (they are literally stealthed assassins, after all) it also makes them actually use stealth just like the player would, and the party either needs to damage them or roll a successful Awareness check to detect them. As you may expect, this mod can be *hard* depending upon your character build, and also whether you're using Sith Assassins with Lightsabers. It does have an option to reduce the difficulty, though, which makes it more immersive and less about you getting your shit kicked in, if that's appealing to you.

**Category & Tier:** Mechanics Change & Immersion / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES


**Installation Instructions:** Unless you intend on playing a character with very high awareness, I recommend the reduced difficulty option if using Lewok's Sith Assassins with Lightsabers, because the damage will be ridiculous. Remember to also apply the compatch for Lewok's mod after running the main install option of your choice, if using it.

### For Mandalore!

**Name:** [For Mandalore!](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2666-for-mandalore/)

**Author:** offthegridmorty

**Description:** Sensed a pattern with Morty and continually putting out banger mods yet? This is a neat one which gives the player the ability to summon Mandalorian reinforcements to support them. Normally this would be too overpowered and kind of out-of-place, but at my request Morty has graciously made an install option specifically for use in the mod builds which only adds the Mandalorian support squads to the *Ravager*, where it makes sense for them to be present and available to come assist the player.

### Peragus Medical Bay Enhancement

**Name:** [Peragus Medical Bay Enhancement](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2513-peragus-medical-bay-enhancement/)

**Author:** WildKarrde

**Description:** A really neat mod which makes the Peragus medical bay a little bit more coherent—you and the miners are no longer expected to breathe bacta gel, for instance. A small mod on balance, but one of my favorites.

**Category & Tier:** Immersion / 2 - Recommended

**Non-English Functionality:** YES


**Installation Instructions:** When installing, for best internal consistency choose install options 1 or 2 (not underwear). Option 2 is technically the most consistent but the visual differentiation is very slight and likely would not be noticeable. When the install is completed, if you would like the miners to have burned skin (as they realistically would have had) move the files from the "OPTION - Burned Skin Textures" folder (or the upscaled textures therein) to your override.

### Droid Models Animation Fix

**Name:** [Droid Models Animation Fix](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2748-droid-models-animation-fix/)

**Author:** CaptainSpoque

**Description:** By default there are several droid NPCs in both KOTOR games which have no animations set for them to dodge, which causes them to just sort of freeze whenever the player attacks them but doesn't land a hit. I've noticed this for years and never realized what it was, but Spoque has put together a package here that adds the dodges to the droid models and fixes them freezing mid-fight.

### AI Upscaled Icon Overhaul

**Name:** [AI Upscaled Icon Overhaul](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1536-tsl-ai-upscaled-icon-overhaul/)

**Author:** Pramod Marlon

**Description:** This mod uses AI upscaling to increase the resolution and quality of all of the over *one thousand* icons in the game, from Force powers to Feats to gear and lightsaber crystals. It does a wonderful job of it, and I only have one complaint—very small icons, such as when selecting items, can look a little pixelated because the resolution of the new icons is actually too large for downscaling to display them properly. In most of the normal situation where you would be seeing an icon, though, you won't notice that.

### Visually Repair HK-47

**Name:** [Visually Repair HK-47](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1434-visually-repair-hk-47/)

**Author:** Kexikus

**Description:** This mod brings to KOTOR 2 the same concept that the original game had with repairing HK. In addition to moderately increasing HK's stats over the course of the repairs (a much-welcome improvement, as droids in KOTOR 2 tend to underperform anyway), this mod also allows you to visually see HK become his old self again as the HK-50 components are gradually integrated, fixed and painted-over. The mod even includes some excellent reskins of the HK-50s and -51s! **AND** it's fully-voiced in a seamless way using original game dialogue! You'll have to forgive me, this is like a wet dream for me, seriously.

### TSL Expanded Ending

**Name:** [TSL Expanded Ending](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2672-tsl-expanded-ending/)

**Author:** WildKarrde

**Description:** Congrats, you are about to experience one of the best mods ever made for KOTOR, and I don't say that lightly. WildKarrde has quietly but consistently put out extremely high-quality content, but they really outdid themselves with this one. This is a comprehensive and *incredibly* professional rework of the ending sequence of KOTOR 2. TSLRCM is famous for tightening the ending up, but it still leaves several plot holes flapping in the wind--how does Malachor get destroyed in an LS ending if HK-47 is never rebuilt and G0-T0 isn't stopped? Why does the Exile have to preserve Malachor if they're DS? How is the party saved? What next? None of these questions are answered, but WildKarrde's mod not only answers them all, it does it with an incredible level of professionalism which makes it feel like it was content straight-up made by Obsidian, on a level more seamless than even restored content from TSLRCM often achieves.

**Author:** Leilukin

**Description:** The player sees Bastila twice in KOTOR 2: once in a holo-recording left in T3's memory banks, and once in a vision from the Tomb of Ludo Kressh. The problem is that the player recognizes Bastila in Kressh's tomb, but not in the holo-recording. There's no reason why this should be, and this mod fixes the discrepancy: the player now recognizes Bastila in T3's recording also.

### Fixed Hologram Models & Admiralty Redux

**Name:** [Fixed Hologram Models & Admiralty Redux](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1201-fixed-hologram-models-and-admiralty-redux-for-tslrcm/)

**Author:** DarthParametric

**Description:** By default the hologram models in TSL are essentially just character models with a transparency effect, which means you can see their models' eye sockets and other internal features through the hologram filter. This mod fixes all these model errors that it can, while also bringing back the Admiralty mod of yore, which reskins Carth and Cede to properly wear Republic officer uniforms in their holograms and in-game appearances.

### Companion Starting Armors

**Name:** [Companion Starting Armors](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2145-k2-companion-starting-armors/)

**Author:** Ol' Cappy

**Description:** Giving companions a unique version of their default clothes so they can keep their 'standard' look throughout the entire game while still having mechanically powerful equipment is a very common mod type. I typically don't like these mods, not because I disagree with the premise but because I tend to balk at +10 WIS modifiers on starting gear. Ol' Cappy, in my opinion, does it right here—these are unique clothes for most of the human companions which don't give insane bonuses, but instead small, rational, and most importantly balanced, lore-friendly and internally-consistent bonuses. These items are never going to be the best your team can get, but they are flavorful additions which will let you keep them in their default get a bit longer, if you so choose.

### Improved LS Enlightenment & DS Corruption Feats

**Name:** [Improved LS Enlightenment & DS Corruption Feats](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2577-improved-ls-enlightenment-ds-corruption-feats/)

**Author:** offthegridmorty

**Description:** Light Side Enlightenment (not to be confused with the Force power Enlightenment) and Dark Side Corruption, the bonus feats given to Jedi Master and Sith Lord prestige classes, are really bad. Not only do they only impact a companion's alignment (which is rarely of use to the player), they are also buggy and can overflow, flinging the companion to the complete opposite alignment than they should be! They basically only exist to make things worse. This mod by Morty gives those feats a clear niche: now, instead of impacting companions' alignment directly, it impacts it indirectly by tripling the effects of any influence gain or loss.

### Repair Affects Stun Droid

**Author:** offthegridmorty

**Description:** Because logically it should, right? Force abilities aren't magical... well, okay, they sort of are, but you know what I mean; their strength and finesse are dependent upon the skill and knowledge of the person using them. It makes sense that a Jedi who is very knowledgable about droids would know exactly how to disable them.

### Improved Force Sight

**Author:** offthegridmorty

**Description:** Another by Morty, and a great companion to his True Sith Assassins mod, this mod improves Force Sight by giving it some more immediate combat utility, allowing it to significantly boost the player's Awareness stat, while also tweaking its behavior for Kreia and Visas.

### Alignment Affects Force Powers

**Name:** [Alignment Affects Force Powers](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2815-alignment-affects-force-powers-tsl/)

**Author:** offthegridmorty

**Description:** Just like its companion mod for KOTOR, this mod is *badass*. Why is it that, if you've fallen to the absolute depth of the Dark Side, you can throw lightning no more powerful than when you were first beginning to fall? Why is it that, as a paragon of the Light, the strength of your connections changes nothing about the power of the Force you can use to defend yourself? Well, now it does. Be an enlightened Jedi with mighty buffs that last an extended duration, or a fierce Sith Lord whose lightnings are easy to cast and mercilessly damaging. But better still, this mod isn't about a power fantasy—there are consequences that come from aligning strongly with one side, leading to atrophied abilities from the other extreme. It's a well-thought-out design that is well-balanced and feels great ingame while also being logically consistent. In my view, that makes this mod a must-have.

### Remove Duplicate TGA/TPC

**Name:** [Remove Duplicate TGA/TPC](https://www.nexusmods.com/kotor/mods/1384) and [**Patch**](https://pastebin.com/6WCN122S)

**Author:** Flachzangen, bash version by /u/th3w1zard1

**Description:** This is a script written by Flachzangen which allows you to remove duplicate .TGA or .TPC files in your game directory. Files with the .TPC filetype take priority, so for several of the patches we've downloaded which are of the .tga filetype, we need to delete any .TPC duplicates in order to get them to read properly. That's what this script will do. It is **CRITICAL** to use this script, as, if .tpc files take priority in some instances, the game will crash.

**Category & Tier:** Patch / 1 - Essential


**Installation Instructions:** Place DelDuplicateTGA-TPC (or the bash script version) in your main game folder (NOT override!), run it, say that **TPC should be deleted** and do not manually confirm. If you are on a Mac or other device that cannot run .bat files and the bash script is not an option for you to use, a list of all the files you will need to manually delete can be found [here](/modding/mod_builds/k2/delete.html).

**MAKE SURE THIS SCRIPT RUNS PROPERLY!** On some operating systems, overzealous antivirus setups, or filepaths with particular characters in them it may fail. If the file outputs "Finished, Press any key to continue" but does not list any files it deleted, it *is not working*, and if it does not work it *will* crash your game. You can try to resolve this by moving your Override folder to a different location (I recommend a subfolder in your Documents or Downloads directories), putting the .bat file there and running it through that directory, but if that doesn't work you will need to manually go through and delete the duplicates from the link above.

### Thematic Obscured Mausoleum Burial

**Name:** [Thematic Obscured Mausoleum Burial](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2663-thematic-obscured-mausoleum-burial/)

**Author:** Sniggles & JCarter426

**Description:** The mod that took us way, *way* longer than it should have. In brief, this mod serves to fix many idiosyncrasies with the visions encountered in the Tomb of Ludo Kressh, as well as adding more player agency and dynamism into the final encounter with your doppelganger and the vision-Revan. For a full breakdown of all changes, please see the attached document on the mod page.

Do note—the fights here can be quite challenging depending upon your choices. Winning them is not mandatory, however, and you will still be able to continue even if you lose at some point.

### Character Textures & Model Fixes

**Name:** [Character Textures & Model Fixes](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2660-4x-upscale-character-textures-model-fixes-tsl/) and [**Patch**](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/452-luxa-hair-fix/)

**Author:** Redrob41

**Description:** Redrob is a quiet legend within the scene, who disappears for years and pops back up with projects nobody expects but which become instant classics. Welcome to the latest. This mod is an upscale of virtually all NPC textures in the game, including aliens and some creatures. But that's not all—Rob is skilled with texture work, and although this package uses AI as a base, he's gone over it by hand and corrected, adjusted, and in some cases entirely retextured parts of the textures to eliminate hallucinations, burring or fuzziness, and preserve the original aesthetic of the texture. What's more, Rob's forte is modeling, and he's included a huge series of model adjustments and fixes along with this package which fixes various rendering issues. I can't recommend this package highly enough.

**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 1 - Essential

**Non-English Functionality:** YES


**Download Instructions:** *Strongly* recommend the 2x .tpc version; the fidelity loss for 2x is minimal, .tpc is a lossless conversion and is much slimmer in filesize, and the automated compatibility program for this mod relies on the filetype being .tpc to function.

**Installation Instructions:** If you are on a system which can run .bat files, I *strongly* recommend using the automated system to deal with compatibility for this mod. To do so, first extract redrob's mod from its archive, then enter the "TSL Optional Kreia Model" folder, copy the four model files within, paste them into the "Copy contents to TSL's Override folder" and overwrite. After this, navigate to [this page](https://github.com/KOTOR-Community-Portal/mod-builds/blob/dev/scripts/cleaner.bat) and click on the button with the arrow pointing down at the top of the code list (the one which says "download raw file"). Place cleaner.bat in the folder from redrob's mod called "Copy contents to TSL's Override folder", then go to [here](https://github.com/KOTOR-Community-Portal/mod-builds/blob/dev/scripts/cleanlist_k2.txt) and repeat the same step, placing cleanlist_k2.txt in the same location. You can now run cleanlist.bat: follow the instructions onscreen, selecting whether you did or didn't use any of the given mods, and the batch file will automatically delete the incompatible files. Once you reach the end of the list, you can exit the .bat window, delete cleaner.bat and cleanlist_k1.txt, and then move the remaining files in the folder to your override.

If you cannot run .bat files or feel uncomfortable running this file, you will need to manually delete the files yourself, following the instructions [here](https://github.com/KOTOR-Community-Portal/mod-builds/blob/dev/content/k2/redrob_deletionsk2.md).
