Name: Mobile TSLRCM (The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod)
Author: zbyl2, DarthStoney, Hassat Hunter & VarsityPuppet
Description: The whole reason why you would mod KOTOR 2, the legendary mod that includes bugfixes, restored content, and altered scenes to return the game to what it was meant to be. This mod isn't just essential—it's mandatory.

Tier: 1 - Essential
IsSelected: true
Directions: >-
  For now, disregard the installation instructions included in the mod, as we will be dragging over the completed installation in batch. Once the mod is downloaded, extract it to a location of your choice on your PC/Mac and delete everything inside the dlc folder except for the 'mods_*x*' directory, the 'x' corresponding to your language of choice.


  You now need to download [this file](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1321-kotor-2-editable-executable/) and place it within your mods_*x* folder. **This file is critical for future installations to function properly**. This is a dummy .exe file which lets later mods install to the right place on your device, and without error. We will delete it as one of the final steps of this installation process, as it's only needed for installations to function normally.


  From this point forward all mods are installed as if the mods_*x* folder is the **main game directory**. For any TSLPatcher executable which asks you to select the main game folder/folder with the executable in it, you will select the mods_*x* folder. Similarly, any mods directing you to place their files within the game's override folder will be placed within the override folder within mods_*x*.
Language:
- YES, *but* you must install the version of MTSLRCM which corresponds to your language of choice.

Name: SSR
Author: Emperor Devon
Description: It's hard to explain this without spoilers—basically, a character confronts your player at a certain point. At the start of this conversation, TSLRCM restores a line which radically changes the tone and impact of the confrontation. Emperor Devon—rightly, I think—concludes that this was content which was cut purposefully rather than for time constraints, and removes the spoken dialogue to restore it to the vanilla standard, where the confrontation begins silently.

Name: Thematic KOTOR 2 Companions
Author: Sniggles & JCarter426
Description: >-
  In the original KOTOR, BioWare did a few wacky things with character progression. Obsidian, not wanting to be outdone, decided to be even worse by just straight-up copying the statlines of several KOTOR companions for KOTOR 2 companions!


  As part of the Thematic series of mods by JC and myself, Thematic KOTOR 2 Companions is a rework of companion starting attributes, skills, feats and powers to lock all companions into having the exact amount of bonuses they should for their level, as well as retuning several of their setups to more closely match the characters' behaviors and backstories. The goal is to ensure that companions' statlines are not only thematically consistent, but also broadly mechanically balanced, to better-incentivize the use of under-utilized party members.

Name: Prestige Class Saving Throw Fixes
Author: Rovan
Description: In KOTOR 2, the player character can unlock higher mysteries of the Force and achieve a prestige class, which amounts to an upgrade to one of the three default Jedi classes (Guardian, Sentinel, and Consular). For some reason, some prestige classes in KOTOR 2 have worse saving throws than their predecessor class. This mod fixes this, ensuring that the more advanced classes always have slightly better throws.

Name: Classic Class Attack Bonus
Author: Crimson Knight
Description: In the original KOTOR, Soldier and Guardian classes had a 1:1 attack bonus; for every one level, they gained +1 attack. For every other class, this ratio was 1.25:1, which made classes feel different ingame and contributed to a difficulty scale. For unknown reasons, KOTOR 2 did away with this differentiation and gave every class a 1:1 ratio. This mod reverts this, giving classes which aren't explicitly melee-focused the 1.25:1 ratio back, restoring a bit of difficulty to what is otherwise a *very* easy game.

Name: Remote Tells Influence
Author: tk102, patch by Leilukin
Description: This is going to require a bit of an explanation. I personally believe this mod breaks immersion—so why add it? In KOTOR 2, companions have [influence](/faq/k2.html#How_does_KOTOR_2's_influence_system_work)—a mechanic by which the player character can influence their allies, either to align with their views or grow hostile to them. Sadly, KOTOR 2's influence system is asinine. Major plot points are locked behind very high—or very low—influence with several companions. Your influence with companions is also extremely obfuscated, only really discernible by a companion's LS/DS alignment relative to your alignment, but this is a very buggy system which breaks with high Charisma values on the player, or with certain feats. There is no other way ingame to tell what your influence is without this mod. I mark it as optional because it *does* break immersion, but for many players I think having a system to determine influence will be extremely important for enjoyment of the story.

Description: You'll eventually encounter a salvager who needs to be saved. While you *can* just opt to kill him, if you're not a psychopath you can choose to save him. But this is a mistake. He has pathfinding so bad it would make the worst escort quest target in history blush in embarassment. This mod by Ozils is an outright lifesaver, applying much-enhanced follower logic to the salvager and automatically teleporting him to the party if you get too far away, so you can guide him to where he needs to go very easily.

Name: Darth Malak's Armor

Description: In KOTOR 2, Darth Malak's armor is an incredibly rare late-game drop not available through normal means without TSLRCM. Unfortunately, in-game the armor doesn't look like Malak's at all. This mod fixes that.

Author: LordRevan999
Description: As ever, you're going to be meeting some Mandalorians in KOTOR 2. It's been 10 years since the Mandalorian Wars and the last time the Mandalorians had a state, though, and their suits should reflect that. This mod helps them along by making their suits a bit more battered and worn-down, reflecting that passage of time from their days of glory.

Name: Enhanced Lightsaber Hilt Variety
Author: J
Description: J's mod here is some more black magic fuckery, finding out a way to make lightsaber "textures" (of a sort) apply both on the legacy patch and Aspyr patch versions of the game, when they were previously broken on the latter. What's more, he's made this mod compatible with JC's lightsaber visual effects above, and also added Crazy34's lightsaber reflections to his sabers, so your (and enemy!) lightsabers will dynamically reflect off of nearby surfaces. The model differentiations here aren't groundbreaking, but they're better than vanilla where all the sabers are entirely the same, especially when you see just how great the reflections look ingame.

DownloadInstructions: Download just the main file (HQSkyboxesII_TSL_1k.7z), not any of the compatches.

Directions: After this mod has finished installing, if you are using the K2CP, extract the K2CP once again—*do not* re-run its TSLPatcher! Open the TSLPatchdata folder and move 231teld.mdl and 231teld.mdx to your override, and overwrite when prompted.

Name: Thorium Charge Mod
Author: darth_gil
Description: Thorium charges are used to blow open heavily-fortified rooms, of which there are two in the game. There are also two thorium charges in the vanilla game—*however*. One of them is hidden behind completing a quest and then re-checking a merchant's inventory (which you are never informed has updated), *and* that merchant can die, or the quest can fail in multiple other ways. I recommend using this mod, which adds an extra Thorium charge in a logical location, just to save a little bit of hassle.

Description: 'Having health regen by default in KOTOR 2 is bad for many reasons: it makes an already easy game easier; it negates the benefit of the health regeneration feat they added; and it makes the use & crafting of medkits and other health-restoring tools much less useful. I played with this mod and the game was still pretty easy by the end, but it was WAY more fun early on. It made me have to worry about health and especially healing items for quite a bit more time, which preserved the challenge.'

The choice of whether to use it or not is entirely up to you; I personally do recommend it simply because the module-based alignment system in the game is not very well-balanced or coherent at present, and we have yet to make a mod which rationalizes it.

Description: For reasons of story, I find that a certain character comes off completely one-dimensional, ruining his own interesting character arc, unless he can express feelings of sentimentality for the main character. Unfortunately this is conveyed via a romance of sorts, and by default this is locked to a female MC. In the interests of presenting this character at their best, this mod causes the character to become obsessed with the player regardless of their gender. I should stress that this is only included because I find it to be fitting regardless of gender, and hold this character's expression of feelings as plot-relevant.

Description: This mod can be considered an add-on to SAwL. It does work differently and can be used standalone (I actively recommend using it even if you choose not to use SAwL), but for the most part it is basically a realism/difficulty enhancement to SAwL. It enhances realism by adding a stealth feature to the same challenge which is modified in SAwL, gives the challenge certain Sneak Attack feats (they should logically have had these), and also forces the player and party to actively roll Awareness to detect the threats. This might sound like, combined with SAwL, it would be insane--and, normally, it would be. I recommend using the reduced difficulty option in this mod so you can have the realism without an unsurvivable difficulty spike.

Name: Droid Models Animation Fix
Author: CaptainSpoque
Description: By default there are several droid NPCs in both KOTOR games which have no animations set for them to dodge, which causes them to just sort of freeze whenever the player attacks them but doesn't land a hit. I've noticed this for years and never realized what it was, but Spoque has put together a package here that adds the dodges to the droid models and fixes them freezing mid-fight.

Description: It's difficult to describe this mod without spoiling its contents, but in essence it allows you to progressively upgrade a companion while visually seeing the progress of your repairs, and also provides an improved skin for that companion so the process is even easier to see. To top it all off, the entire sequence is lore-friendly and completely voiced by vanilla companion dialogue. It's an excellent mod.

Name: Companion Starting Armors
Author: Ol' Cappy
Description: Giving companions a unique version of their default clothes so they can keep their 'standard' look throughout the entire game while still having mechanically powerful equipment is a very common mod type. I typically don't like these mods, not because I disagree with the premise but because I tend to balk at +10 WIS modifiers on starting gear. Ol' Cappy, in my opinion, does it right here—these are unique clothes for most of the human companions which don't give insane bonuses, but instead small, rational, and most importantly balanced, lore-friendly and internally-consistent bonuses. These items are never going to be the best your team can get, but they are flavorful additions which will let you keep them in their default get a bit longer, if you so choose.

Name: Improved LS Enlightenment & DS Corruption Feats
Author: offthegridmorty
Description: "Without spoiling anything about it, KOTOR 2 has a prestige class system: unique classes that give the player certain benefits. The bonuses for two of these specific classes, Light Side Enlightenment and Dark Side Corruption, are really bad. Not only do they only impact a companion's alignment (which is rarely of use to the player), they are also buggy and can overflow, flinging the companion to the complete opposite alignment than they should be! They basically only exist to make things worse. This mod by Morty gives those feats a clear niche: now, instead of impacting companions' alignment directly, it impacts it indirectly by tripling the effects of any influence gain or loss."

Name: Alignment Affects Force Powers
Author: offthegridmorty
Description: Just like its companion mod for KOTOR, this mod is *badass*. Why is it that, if you've fallen to the absolute depth of the Dark Side, you can throw lightning no more powerful than when you were first beginning to fall? Why is it that, as a paragon of the Light, the strength of your connections changes nothing about the power of the Force you can use to defend yourself? Well, now it does. Be an enlightened Jedi with mighty buffs that last an extended duration, or a fierce Sith Lord whose lightnings are easy to cast and mercilessly damaging. But better still, this mod isn't about a power fantasy—there are consequences that come from aligning strongly with one side, leading to atrophied abilities from the other extreme. It's a well-thought-out design that is well-balanced and feels great ingame while also being logically consistent. In my view, that makes this mod a must-have.

Name: Remove Duplicate TGA/TPC
Author: Flachzangen, bash version by /u/th3w1zard1
Description: This is a script written by Flachzangen which allows you to remove duplicate .TGA or .TPC files in your game directory. Files with the .TPC filetype take priority, so for several of the patches we've downloaded which are of the .tga filetype, we need to delete any .TPC duplicates in order to get them to read properly. That's what this script will do. It is **CRITICAL** to use this script, as, if .tpc files take priority in some instances, the game will crash.
Category:
- Patch
Tier: 1 - Essential
IsSelected: true
Directions: >-
  Place DelDuplicateTGA-TPC (or the bash script version) in your main game folder (NOT override!), run it, say that **TPC should be deleted** and do not manually confirm. If you are on a Mac or other device that cannot run .bat files and the bash script is not an option for you to use, a list of all the files you will need to manually delete can be found [here](/modding/mod_builds/k1/delete.html).


  **MAKE SURE THIS SCRIPT RUNS PROPERLY!** On some operating systems, overzealous antivirus setups, or filepaths with particular characters in them it may fail. If the file outputs "Finished, Press any key to continue" but does not list any files it deleted, it *is not working*, and if it does not work it *will* crash your game. You can try to resolve this by moving your Override folder to a different location (I recommend a subfolder in your Documents or Downloads directories), putting the .bat file there and running it through that directory, but if that doesn't work you will need to manually go through and delete the duplicates from the link above.

  Before proceeding, delete the dummy executable used to facilitate the mod installations. If the device you're currently using runs a Windows OS, download one of the executable files from the linked github page matching your operating system's architecture (32-bit or 64-bit; google which your Windows OS is if you're not sure), place the file in the main dummy directory which you have created to install the mods to (NOT the override folder), and run the executable.


  If you are on MacOS or Linux, first, run Terminal and navigate to your mods_english directory with the cd command.


  `cd [full filepath to mods_english on your device]`


  Then, enter the following command:
