Name=4GB Patcher
Author=Daniel Pistelli
Description=This is a program which modifies your game's executable file to be able to utilize up to 4 gigabytes of RAM, since KOTOR is a 32-bit application and by default can only utilize 2 gigabytes. This will help the game run smoothly even with the larger texture throughput this build creates, and also reduces issues caused by a memory leak which is native to the game, preventing crashes and savegame corruption.

Directions=This step should only be performed if you are **NOT** on the Aspyr patch and have not applied J's 3C-FD patcher! 3C-FD applies this as part of its fixes to the Aspyr version. Just like 3C-FD, since the Mac Appstore version is not an executable, this program cannot be utilized on the Mac Appstore edition of the game.

Language=PARTIAL - All components can be installed *except* for Trayus Mandalore Conversation.
ModLinkFilenames=http://deadlystream.com/files/file/296-unofficial-tslrcm-tweak-pack/
Directions=Don't use the complete installer, instead selecting the individual component installer—this is *critical* for compatibility, not just to choose specific options. The installer for this mod will need to be run 6 times, once to install each of the options we'll be using: Kaevee Removal Parts 1 & 2, Saedhe's Head, Kreia-Atris Dialogue Tweak, Trayus Mandalore Conversation, and Trayus Sith Lord Masks. Most of the other options for this mod are untested with the mod builds, but will likely function--I still recommend against using them, since compatibility isn't 100% guaranteed, but you can try. The one exception is *Atton at the End*, which is completely incompatible with one of the most important mods in this build, which is a much more comprehensive implementation of Atton's dialogue at endgame.

Description=Another TSLRCM change I am not personally thrilled with—when Sion encounters the Exile for the first time in TSLRCM on the *Harbinger*, he speaks to them a line of warning. That engagement takes so much tension out of the scene, and this mod reverts it to the vanilla standard: when Sion appears at the end of the hall he only slowly walks towards the party, threatening and menacing.

Name=Thematic KOTOR 2 Companions
Author=Sniggles & JCarter426
Description=In the original KOTOR, BioWare did a few wacky things with character progression. Obsidian, not wanting to be outdone, decided to be even worse by just straight-up copying the statlines of several KOTOR companions for KOTOR 2 companions!

As part of the Thematic series of mods by JC and myself, Thematic KOTOR 2 Companions is a rework of companion starting attributes, skills, feats and powers to lock all companions into having the exact amount of bonuses they should for their level, as well as retuning several of their setups to more closely match the characters' behaviors and backstories. The goal is to ensure that companions' statlines are not only thematically consistent, but also broadly mechanically balanced, to better-incentivize the use of under-utilized party members.

Name=Classic Class Attack Bonus
Author=Crimson Knight
Description=In the original KOTOR, Soldier and Guardian classes had a 1:1 attack bonus; for every one level, they gained +1 attack. For every other class, this ratio was 1.25:1, which made classes feel different ingame and contributed to a difficulty scale. For unknown reasons, KOTOR 2 did away with this differentiation and gave every class a 1:1 ratio. This mod reverts this, giving classes which aren't explicitly melee-focused the 1.25:1 ratio back, restoring a bit of difficulty to what is otherwise a *very* easy game.

Name=Remote Tells Influence
Author=tk102, patch by Leilukin
Description=This is going to require a bit of an explanation. I personally believe this mod breaks immersion—so why add it? The bottom-line is that KOTOR 2's influence system is asinine, and major plot points are locked behind very high—or very low—influence with several companions. Your influence with companions is also extremely obfuscated, only really discernible by their LS/DS alignment relative to your alignment, but this is a very buggy system which breaks with high Charisma values on the player, or with certain feats. There is no other way ingame to tell what your influence is without this mod. I mark it as optional because it *does* break immersion, but for many players I think having a system to determine influence will be extremely important for enjoyment of the story.

His pathfinding would make the most awful escort quest target in history blush in embarassment.

ModLinkFilenames=https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2355-transparent-cockpit-windows-for-tsl/
Directions=Apply the main installation, then go into the Compatibility Patches folder and apply any of the following you use in this order: K2CP ("K2CP and_or Nar Shaddaa Landing Pad Repair by PapaZinos"), "High Quality Skyboxes II by Kexikus" (but *NOT* the 'M4-78 with HQ Skyboxes II' folder!), and "Spark Effect - Ebon Hawk by PapaZinos". **DO NOT USE** the content of the "Korriban Distorted Model Fix" folder, even if you are on the Aspyr patch! With the C3-FD patcher, this is no longer a concern.
DownloadInstructions=I recommend the reskin-friendly version; the reflectivity version is untested with the builds and may look odd.

Directions=Move the loose files to the override, followed by the file in the "With Nar Realistic Skybox" folder if you use HQ Skyboxes II.
DownloadInstructions=Download the version of the mod you would like based upon how detailed you want the cockpit skyboxes to appear. Keep in mind that load time into the Ebon Hawk could be significantly increased if using very large cockpit textures, and there's also a risk of save corruption when using very large texture sizes—I recommend the Medium texture option for the best balance of quality and size/performance. Whatever size you decide to use, make sure to use the .tpc format files!

Even if you intend to use the High-Resolution Cutscenes mod included under the extended widescreen support section at the bottom of this list, I still recommend this mod; they function basically the same, but by using this mod the characters in the cutscene will use their new textures if any are applied, thereby making it more immersive and further increasing its quality above that of the pre-recorded cutscene, which relies on vanilla textures.

Name=PartySwap
Author=DarthTyren & Leilukin
Description=PartySwap is a legendary mod, and one of the best ever made for KOTOR 2. Through some unobtrusive scripting magic, it allows you to bring both the Disciple and Handmaiden with you as companions simultaneously, without removing another companion from the party wheel. You can experience all their content and use them both throughout the entire campaign, as was originally intended by Obsidian.

Be aware, however, that PartySwap *does* require some fourth wall-breaking elements, including the need to use a script and dialogue window to summon the Handmaiden in order for its party trickery to work. I don't like this any more than you probably do, but I still think having both the Handmaiden and Disciple is far superior to having only one of them, and I think it's an acceptable price for what the mod provides.

The mod gives you a stim to manage the Handmaiden and Disciple (spawning & despawning them) which you use to run the script. This stim appears in the *shields* quickbar at the bottom-left of the screen, however; be aware of this, since it doesn't show up in the normal stims category!

As you may expect, this mod can be *hard* depending upon your character build, and also whether you're using Sith Assassins with Lightsabers.

Author=offthegridmorty
Description=Sensed a pattern with Morty and continually putting out banger mods yet? This is a neat one which gives the player the ability to summon Mandalorian reinforcements to support them. Normally this would be too overpowered and kind of out-of-place, but at my request Morty has graciously made an install option specifically for use in the mod builds which only adds the Mandalorian support squads to the *Ravager*, where it makes sense for them to be present and available to come assist the player.

Description=This mod uses AI upscaling to increase the resolution and quality of all of the over *one thousand* icons in the game, from Force powers to Feats to gear and lightsaber crystals. It does a wonderful job of it, and I only have one complaint—very small icons, such as when selecting items, can look a little pixelated because the resolution of the new icons is actually too large for downscaling to display them properly.

In addition to moderately increasing HK's stats over the course of the repairs (a much-welcome improvement, as droids in KOTOR 2 tend to underperform anyway), this mod also allows you to visually see HK become his old self again as the HK-50 components are gradually integrated, fixed and painted-over.

Description=Congrats, you are about to experience one of the best mods ever made for KOTOR, and I don't say that lightly. WildKarrde has quietly but consistently put out extremely high-quality content, but they really outdid themselves with this one. This is a comprehensive and *incredibly* professional rework of the ending sequence of KOTOR 2. TSLRCM is famous for tightening the ending up, but it still leaves several plot holes flapping in the wind--how does Malachor get destroyed in an LS ending if HK-47 is never rebuilt and G0-T0 isn't stopped? Why does the Exile have to preserve Malachor if they're DS? How is the party saved? What next? None of these questions are answered, but WildKarrde's mod not only answers them all, it does it with an incredible level of professionalism which makes it feel like it was content straight-up made by Obsidian, on a level more seamless than even restored content from TSLRCM often achieves.

Description=Giving companions a unique version of their default clothes so they can keep their 'standard' look throughout the entire game while still having mechanically powerful equipment is a very common mod type. I typically don't like these mods, not because I disagree with the premise but because I tend to balk at +10 WIS modifiers on starting gear. Ol' Cappy, in my opinion, does it right here—these are unique clothes for most of the human companions which don't give insane bonuses, but instead small, rational, and most importantly balanced, lore-friendly and internally-consistent bonuses. These items are never going to be the best your team can get, but they are flavorful additions which will let you keep them in their default get a bit longer, if you so choose.

Description=Light Side Enlightenment (not to be confused with the Force power Enlightenment) and Dark Side Corruption, the bonus feats given to Jedi Master and Sith Lord prestige classes, are really bad. Not only do they only impact a companion's alignment (which is rarely of use to the player), they are also buggy and can overflow, flinging the companion to the complete opposite alignment than they should be! They basically only exist to make things worse. This mod by Morty gives those feats a clear niche: now, instead of impacting companions' alignment directly, it impacts it indirectly by tripling the effects of any influence gain or loss.

Description=Just like its companion mod for KOTOR, this mod is *badass*. Why is it that, if you've fallen to the absolute depth of the Dark Side, you can throw lightning no more powerful than when you were first beginning to fall? Why is it that, as a paragon of the Light, the strength of your connections changes nothing about the power of the Force you can use to defend yourself? Well, now it does. Be an enlightened Jedi with mighty buffs that last an extended duration, or a fierce Sith Lord whose lightnings are easy to cast and mercilessly damaging. But better still, this mod isn't about a power fantasy—there are consequences that come from aligning strongly with one side, leading to atrophied abilities from the other extreme. It's a well-thought-out design that is well-balanced and feels great ingame while also being logically consistent. In my view, that makes this mod a must-have.

If the file outputs "Finished, Press any key to continue" but does not list any files it deleted, it *is not working*, and if it does not work it *will* crash your game. You can try to resolve this by moving your Override folder to a different location (I recommend a subfolder in your Documents or Downloads directories), putting the .bat file there and running it through that directory, but if that doesn't work you will need to manually go through and delete the duplicates from the link above.

This mod is an upscale of virtually all NPC textures in the game, including aliens and some creatures. But that's not all—Rob is skilled with texture work, and although this package uses AI as a base, he's gone over it by hand and corrected, adjusted, and in some cases entirely retextured parts of the textures to eliminate hallucinations, burring or fuzziness, and preserve the original aesthetic of the texture. What's more, Rob's forte is modeling, and he's included a huge series of model adjustments and fixes along with this package which fixes various rendering issues.

After this, navigate to [this page](https://github.com/KOTOR-Community-Portal/mod-builds/blob/dev/scripts/cleaner.bat) and click on the button with the arrow pointing down at the top of the code list (the one which says "download raw file"). Place cleaner.bat in the folder from redrob's mod called "Copy contents to TSL's Override folder", then go to [here](https://github.com/KOTOR-Community-Portal/mod-builds/blob/dev/scripts/cleanlist_k2.txt) and repeat the same step, placing cleanlist_k2.txt in the same location. You can now run cleanlist.bat: follow the instructions onscreen, selecting whether you did or didn't use any of the given mods, and the batch file will automatically delete the incompatible files. Once you reach the end of the list, you can exit the .bat window, delete cleaner.bat and cleanlist_k1.txt, and then move the remaining files in the folder to your override.\n\nIf you cannot run .bat files or feel uncomfortable running this file, you will need to manually delete the files yourself, following the instructions [here](https://github.com/KOTOR-Community-Portal/mod-builds/blob/dev/content/k2/redrob_deletionsk2.md).
DownloadInstructions=*Strongly* recommend the 2x .tpc version; the fidelity loss for 2x is minimal, .tpc is a lossless conversion and is much slimmer in filesize, and the automated compatibility program for this mod relies on the filetype being .tpc to function.
