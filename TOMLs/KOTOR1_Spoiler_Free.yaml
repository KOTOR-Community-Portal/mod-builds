Guid: 9373df5f-ce7b-4090-8375-6e9521be1388
Name: KOTOR Dialogue Fixes
Author: Salk & Kainzorus Prime
Description: In addition to fixing several typos, this mod takes the PC's dialogue—which is written in such a way as to make the PC sound constantly shocked, stupid, or needlessly evil—and replaces it with more moderate and reasonable responses, even for DS choices.
Category:
- Immersion
Tier: 1 - Essential
IsSelected: true
Directions: The choice of which version to use is up to you; I recommend PC Response Moderation, as in vanilla your character sounds like a giddy little schoolchild following even the most minor dialogue interactions, and that mod serves to correct that without actually changing the underlying dialogue much, but if you prefer only bugfixes that option is compatible. Just move your chosen dialog.tlk file to the *main game directory* (where the executable would normally be)—in this very specific case, NOT the override.

Name: Thematic KOTOR Companions
Author: Sniggles & JCarter426
Description: >-
  BioWare did a few wacky things with character progression in this game. To an extent that's novel, since it helps make companions feel more unique and less rigidly tied to the D&D system if they can be stronger than what the system otherwise allows. But it becomes less novel when you realize that most of what they did is just make Jedi companions super OP and short most other party members on stats & feats they should have had.


  As part of the Thematic series of mods by JC and myself, Thematic KOTOR Companions is a rework of companion starting attributes, skills, feats and powers to lock all companions into having the exact amount of bonuses they should for their level, as well as retuning several of their setups to more closely match the characters' behaviors and backstories. The goal is to ensure that companions' statlines are not only thematically consistent, but also broadly mechanically balanced, to better-incentivize the use of under-utilized party members.


  Companion names, genders, and some information about their backstories have been censored in the attached changes breakdown to avoid spoilers.

Name: KOTOR Community Patch
Author: Various Authors; Darth Parametric, JCarter426 & A Future Pilot Collate
Description: >-
  An ambitious compilation intending to be a comprehensive bugfix mod for the original game, the KOTOR Community Patch combines hundreds of various fixes and improvements from over a dozen other mods, as well as fixes put together by AFP, DP and JC on their own. With bugfixes as important to KOTOR as TSLRCM's are to KOTOR 2, I can't recommend its use highly enough.


  Please make sure to **NOT READ** the list of changes included within the mod, however; due to its size and composite nature, I can't censor information for the whole thing, and there's a lot of spoilers in it if you read the readme fully!

Name: Cloaked Jedi Robes
Author: JCarter426
Description: The robes in KOTOR 2 are of a more billowing, loose style than the tight-fitting and narrow robes that KOTOR usually features, and seem to be the fanbase's preference. This mod migrates the KOTOR 2 robes into the original game, while still leaving options to retain some of the aesthetic choices of vanilla.

Author: JCarter426
Description: It's very annoying when you've got your party together and you want to show your swag off with color-coordinated outfits, but the game only gives you gaudy blue robes. Worry no longer! JC has given us a solution in the form of a skilled Trandoshan tailor, who will dye your robes on demand—it's also compatible with Cloaked Jedi Robes! He even has some very well-written and lore-friendly dialogue about current events.

Name: Unique Sith Governor
Author: N-DReW25
Description: >-
  This is a mod I specifically requested because, by default, a certain Sith Governor you encounter uses the same model and texture as many other Sith in the game. I felt that visually differentiating them a bit would make the other Sith seem more unique by comparison, and thus this mod.

Name: Sith Uniform Reformation Revised
Author: Heyorange, Sith Holocron, JCarter426
Description: If you ever want a window into incredibly minor things that I think are really cool, this is the cream of the crop. Vanilla KOTOR doesn't really have much rhyme or reason behind differentiating the appearance of the Sith soldiers you encounter, except for rule of cool. This mod makes the clothing of each rank clear and consistent, with an established breakdown of epaulettes, as well as rank and regiment insignias. New, and thanks to Sith Holocron, these textures have also been further enhanced and upscaled to match the rest of the vanilla game's upscales present in the mod builds.

Author: WildKarrde
Description: By default when landing on Yavin station (a merchant hub), you leave the *Ebon Hawk* and are placed directly into a hallway, but in the intro movie for Yavin you can see the *Ebon Hawk* landing in a hangar that looks... well, remarkably similar to another hangar in the game.

Name: New Lightsaber Blade Models
Author: Crazy34
Description: With this mod, Crazy34 walked into the community, slammed down one of the most impressive mods ever made for this game, and dared us to do better. Not only have they split the blade texture in two to allow for lightsabers with cores of a different color (currently unsupported in the build release, but hopefully coming soon), they've also added *dynamic reflections* to each and every lightsaber across every area of the game. When you're fighting a Dark Jedi, you're going to see your faces bathed in shifting colors, fading and brightening as you swing your lightsabers; when you ignite your saber in a hallway, it will reflect on the floor and walls, and will realistically increase in intensity as the blade draws nearer to the surface. This is an incredible project, and easily one of the most important—and impressive—mods ever released for KOTOR. In the next few years, it could completely change the face of lightsaber modding.

Description: "Originally, swoop bikes in KOTOR were intended to have upgrades available for purchase which would modify their performance to make winning races easier. This mod restores two upgrades to the game: one that reduces the speed loss taken when hitting an obstacle, and one which increases acceleration. Right now this mod isn't a perfect implementation of what I'd like, including too few upgrades which are a bit pricey relative to the benefit they give, but I still think it's better for players to have the option to use them than not."

Name: "JC's Romance Enhancement: Dark Sacrifice"
Author: JCarter426
Description: "In vanilla, with some small variation KOTOR has a binary ending: Light Side or Dark Side. But it wasn't always so—until quite late in development a very unique ending for Dark Side players who romanced Carth, one of your first companions, was still being developed, and voice lines were even recorded for it. For unknown reasons this ending was cut, but with this mod it has now been restored. You are not locked into this alternate ending, it's only presented as an option which your character may choose. More than this can't be revealed to avoid spoilers, but do note that unless you intend to play as a DS character capable of romancing Carth, this mod will not present any changes. Please also note, in vanilla only females can romance Carth, but a third-party mod by Leilukin not present in this guide makes Carth able to be romanced by male characters, and is compatible with this mod."

Name: Saber Throw Knockdown Effect
Author: uwadmin12
Description: By default, the "Throw Lightsaber" power is a little weak. Not only does it seem like it takes forever, it does much less damage in a much smaller AoE than other powers available to the party Jedi! The goal of this mod is giving Advanced Throw Lightsaber some additional functionality that makes using it worthwhile, namely the inclusion of a knockdown effect on the primary target if that target fails to pass a saving throw. This can make the ability useful for screening particular zones while also dealing damage—still somewhat less effective than most other powers, but with more guaranteed damage.

Name: PC Dialogue with Davik's Slave Change
Author: Leilukin
Description: "2003 was a different time, but this mod *really* proves that. In vanilla, if you request a 'massage' from some slaves—which has some sexual implications in Star Wars—you get nothing more than a disgusted remark from some companions. You can even threaten them without consequence. This mod properly amends this, giving you two options: for those deeply bothered by the ability to take advantage of the slaves the option to pressure them into servicing you can be removed entirely, whereas the second retains the massage, but gives Dark Side points for requesting it, as well as adding DS points for threatening the slaves at any point."

Name: Repeating Blaster Attacks Restoration
Author: R2-X2
Description: Blasters in the original KOTOR are underpowered all-around, but out of the entire laughingstock none is worse than blaster repeaters, which cost more in return for equivalent damage and less crit chance. It turns out that these weapons were originally supposed to have two attack rounds, but BioWare didn't have the time or know-how to implement this before the game went gold. This mod restores this function, with only a few instances where it doesn't work due to hardcoded scripting.

Description: "It's difficult for me to talk about this mod without gushing about it. In my opinion, this mod is the best piece of added quest content ever made for either KOTOR or KOTOR 2: best-written, best-structured, best-balanced, best-voiced, and most sensible. It brings the player's past into the equation without mandating anything about their nature, and provides a real and immersive look at what your character's past was, and future could be, all while being lore-friendly to BOTH KOTOR 2 and The Old Republic. The only reason this mod isn't marked as Essential is because it reuses one module in a way which doesn't allow for suspension of disbelief--everything else about this mod is perfect."

Description: This mod makes one of the enemies you encounter in the course of the game unexpectedly (but rationally) attack you with lightsabers and an impressive array of equipment. Defeating them grants excellent loot, but the fight will be incredibly challenging. To preserve the surprise, I have censored any information which could reveal the nature of this enemy.

Name: Taris Dueling Arena Adjustment
Author: DarthParametric
Description: The Taris dueling arena is one of the best ways to make money on the planet, which means you're likely to be spending a decent chunk of time there. Unfortunately, the "crowd" in the arena is, by default, just a few sprites stuffed in the background. They look awful, and I bet they looked awful even in 2003. Blessedly, this mod fixes that by switching the sprites out with a much more dense crowd, as well as fixing other miscellaneous issues with the arena.

Description: >-
  In the vanilla version of KOTOR that shipped, there is actually a romance option between two female characters, though it's tough as sin to proc due to a myriad of bugs (fixed by the K1CP in this mod package). Even so, it's very underdone and has no real conclusion to speak of. This mod's goal is to at least provide some basic closure to the romance and confirm that yes, you did actually proc it properly.

Author: Flachzangen, bash version by /u/th3w1zard1
Description: This is a script written by Flachzangen which allows you to remove duplicate .TGA or .TPC files in your game directory. Files with the .TPC filetype take priority, so for several of the patches we've downloaded which are of the .tga filetype, we need to delete any .TPC duplicates in order to get them to read properly. That's what this script will do.

Tier: 1 - Essential
IsSelected: true
Directions: Place DelDuplicateTGA-TPC (or the bash script version) in your main game folder (NOT override!), run it, say that TPC should be deleted and do not manually confirm. If you are on a Mac or other device that cannot run .bat files and the bash script is not an option for you to use, a list of all the files you will need to manually delete can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kotor/wiki/k1buildtpcdelete). MAKE SURE THIS SCRIPT RUNS PROPERLY!
