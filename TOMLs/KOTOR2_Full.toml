preambleContent = "# KOTOR 2 Full Build\r\n\r\n## Installation Notes\r\n\r\n:::warning\r\nImportant\r\n:   If you were linked to this list directly without reading the install instructions, please go back and read them [here](/modding/mod_builds)! There are several critical setup and general best-practice steps you need to be aware of before beginning the install process. The instructions for how this list is installed are located on that page, not this build!\r\n:::\r\n\r\n### Zeroing Step\r\n\r\nUnless you have *freshly* installed the game or have never installed KOTOR 2 previously, please blank-slate your setup: uninstall the game, delete the full contents of your game's directory (the entire folder where the executable file previously was located; this does **NOT** always happen automatically when the game is uninstalled), and reinstall the game. A significant amount of troubleshooting support we offer is the result of leftover game files or file corruption from a game which was installed many years ago. Performing this zeroing step helps to ensure your local copy is fresh, uncorrupted, and free of any old mod data.\r\n\r\nOnce you have your freshly-installed copy of the game, please attempt to set your main game directory and all subfolders as *not* read-only. This is because executable mods will need to modify the files therein directly to install properly. Some operating systems (particularly Windows OS 8+) will lock the settings on these folders depending on their locations, so for many systems it will not be possible to actually pull them out of their read-only state, but it is important to at at least attempt to change the folders, as on some operating systems it is necessary for a functional install.\r\n\r\n### KOTOR 2 on Steam\r\n\r\nIf you are playing KOTOR 2 on Steam, *please* check that you're not subscribed to any content on the Workshop--yes, even if you're double-triple-super positive you're not. At least 2-3 times a month we have people come in asking for tech support swearing that they're not subbed to anything on the Workshop, then they go check and it turns out that they subbed to TSLRCM a decade ago and completely forgot about it. It's not fun to find that out after you start your game.\r\n\r\nChecking is very simple: just go to your Steam library, right-click KOTOR 2 and select properties, then go to the Workshop tab and confirm nothing appears in the list. Doing this not only helps you avoid major errors during the install process, it also helps us to help you in the event that something goes wrong with your install, because we'll know immediately that the Workshop isn't the problem.\r\n\r\n### TSLPatcher Installation Requirements\r\n\r\nDo not, under **ANY CIRCUMSTANCES**, run a TSLPatcher or HoloPatcher executable from within a file archive (IE a compressed file like a .rar, .zip, .7z, etc). You *must* extract all archives before installing mod content, or running an executable. Failure to extract before installing will break your game. Also, ensure you don't extract installer-based mods to the same folder. If, for example, you extract every single mod to a folder called \"KOTOR Mods\", each time you extract you'll be overwriting critical data from the previous mods. Make sure each installer-based mod is extracted to its own folder before running the installer.\r\n\r\nPlease also bear in mind: if you are asked to direct a TSLPatcher or Holopatcher executable to a folder to begin install, that folder should ALWAYS be the main game folder, where your game's .exe file is located (or the symlink to that folder created in the optional Quicker TSLPatching step, discussed further below). For mods that are NOT installed with the TSLPatcher or Holopatcher, *unless otherwise noted* their loose-file contents are placed directly in the Override directory. Unless you are following specific instructions (the mod author's or my own) that state otherwise, you should not be placing files in the game's main directory or Modules folder. You should *never* have any subfolders inside the Modules or Override folders.\r\n\r\nAs a final note, be aware that the TSLPatcher executable utilized in the installation process of many of these mods (frustratingly) does not always function on multi-monitor setups. If you have more than one monitor, you may need to disable your second while installing the mods, but you can re-enable it once the installation process is complete.\r\n\r\n### Single Install\r\n\r\nIt is critical to ensure that you only have **ONE** installation of KOTOR on your device before beginning the installation process. If you have multiple installations, or even just two game executables in different locations, mod installers which are set up to auto-detect your game's installation directory *will* misidentify which one is correct and install the mods wherever they please, probably spiking your whole install in the process. If you want to make a backup of your vanilla gamestate, make sure to compress the entire game into an archive (.rar, .zip, .7z, etc.) before starting the install process.\r\n\r\n### Updating from a Prior Build\r\n\r\nIf you currently have a prior mod build version installed and would like to update to the current Revision, due to the importance of install order to the mod builds' function, there is unfortunately no way to do so without resetting to a fresh install and reinstalling the new build iteration on top. To do this, just perform the zeroing step listed above: uninstall your game, delete all remaining contents in the game directory (remember, frequently, especially on the Steam release of the game, mod content *will not* be uninstalled as part of the application's uninstallation), and then reinstall the game before applying the new build version.\r\n\r\n### Linux Players\r\n\r\nPlease note, case-sensitivity is an issue with many Linux systems (as you may expect). For those not running a case-insensitive distro, you will need to batch-lowercase any mod files--*any* mod files, not just the files that end up in your override directory. It's likely you will need to both lowercase the files before installing any installer-based mod and then again at the end of the process as a batch action in your game directory and all subfolders, as the TSLPatcher/HoloPatcher will generate several files as part of their install processes which will have capitals that are misread.\r\n\r\nMost Linux players appear to be using Proton these days, and for those that do there are some known issues with it, both related to crashes with certain older Proton versions and with rendering issues on newer Proton releases. I don't use Linux and don't feel qualified to try to summarize the issues and fixes here, but just be aware if you run into trouble there are several pins in the [Discord's](https://discord.gg/qw7NhM6EW5) #tech_support channel dealing with Proton and how to resolve both issues (the crashing & rendering problems).\r\n\r\n### Known Bugs\r\n\r\n* Although all instances of this error should now be fixed, some textures may still have a partial transparency effect applied to them (you will be able to faintly see through them, or part of them, as if they were a slightly more opaque hologram). If you encounter any instances of such textures please report them so I can fix any leftovers.\r\n* There are significant camera angle errors in the scene where Carth is on the *Sojourn*'s bridge approaching Telos to engage the *Ravager*. We currently don't know why this is and are looking into it actively. The scene still plays properly, including audible dialogue, the camera simply doesn't face the proper direction when doing so.\r\n* For some users, the game may very rarely crash on load when trying to enter a new area due to a data overflow. This is extremely uncommon and most users should never encounter it, but it is impossible to fully prevent. Fortunately, it is easy to fix if it does happen: simply temporarily disable the 'Frame Buffer Effects' and \"Soft Shadows\" settings in your advanced graphics options, proceed through the load screen, then re-enable the settings once on the other side. Again, most players should never encounter this.\r\n\r\n### Total Filesize on Disk\r\n\r\nFor your reference, the total filesize of all mods before extraction, excluding movies, is approximately 6.5GB. The total size of the install when extracted, including basegame files but excluding upscaled movies, is approximately 15.5GB. The total size of the install when extracted (plus HD movies (Pops Maellard's version) in 1920x1080 resolution) is approximately 35GB. Please bear this in mind if you intend to keep backups and/or are operating on a system with limited available memory.\r\n\r\n## Optional Install Assistant - Quicker TSLPatching\r\n\r\nBecause of the way KOTOR mods install, it's virtually impossible to have a true mod manager/installer hybrid like those you may be familiar with for other games, like MO2 or FOMM. The best we can really get are tools to accelerate installations, of which one is supported for the mod builds.\r\n\r\n### Quicker TSLPatching\r\n\r\n[**Quicker TSLPatching**](https://www.nexusmods.com/kotor/mods/1214?tab=description) is a system workaround (specifically a registry edit) which makes it easier to install mods. This script *will not work* on Mac operating systems (neither Linux, I believe) not running Windows on a partition, but there are some comments in the Posts section of the download page that might offer alternatives that allow it to function properly.\r\n\r\nThis mod features no level of automation, and only serves to speed up the install process of mods installed via the TSLPatcher executable. Mods will frequently use the TSLPatcher to install, and the TSLPatcher often requires you to manually point the installer at your game's base installation directory. Sometimes the patchers do this automatically, but sometimes they fail, which is where this script comes in; it'll create a symlink to your KOTOR and KOTOR 2 install directories direct to your desktop, where the TSLPatcher defaults to pointing, so you only need to scroll down and click the folder to install without navigating through your system's file structure to find the game folder. The script is confirmed safe and once your install is complete you can delete the desktop folders with no problems. To install, you only need to run the script and follow the instructions it presents, choosing your KOTOR directory in the first popup window and your KOTOR 2 directory in the second. If the script does not function for you, check the Posts section of the mod download page to see some alternate suggestions for manually forcing the functionality of the script.\r\n\r\n## CRITICAL: PC Version Differences & Fixes\r\n\r\n:::warning\r\nWarning\r\n:   **Your entire install could be unstable if the information in this step is not taken into account**. I hope that's gotten everyone's attention, because it really is that important. This section will be a bit long by necessity, but it is critical.\r\n:::\r\n\r\nKOTOR 2 has multiple different versions. The easiest way to refer to these are the Aspyr patch and legacy version. The legacy version is the original release, while the Aspyr patch is a newer update and the default version of the Steam, GoG, and Mac Appstore game copies. It may also be on some more obscure storefronts like the Amazon Games version of KOTOR 2, but we haven't been able to find anyone who owns it there to confirm--if you're ever unsure about which copy you're using, you can boot a freshly-installed copy of the game up with a controller plugged in and see if it responds to controller commands: if it does, you have the patch. If you don't have a controller handy, you can check the resolution options available ingame; if you see 1920x1080 or ultrawide options, you have the patch.\r\n\r\nAs implied by the above, the Aspyr patch adds some useful functionality like native controller and widescreen support. The patch unfortunately also adds several bugs. Until recently most of these problems were not fixable, though some had workarounds. However, through a series of new tools and patches by J, *all* of the serious problems caused by the Aspyr patch can now be fixed. The only significant issues of note that remain are:\r\n\r\n1. The possibility of losing savegames (this can be entirely avoided just by turning off cloud saves)\r\n2. What can best be described as \"dialogue floatiness\". Sometimes the dialogue will just... skip, for no good reason. This is different than memory leak-related dialogue skipping, if you're familiar with that in the context of KOTOR. It's more like delayed input reading, where one mouse press to bypass a dialogue line will register as two and instantly skip the next dialogue as well. This is a really annoying bug, but thankfully is fairly rare.\r\n3. When playing with a controller plugged in, even if not *actually using* the controller, it can cause an issue where the camera becomes vertically offset after upgrading an item in the workbench. Unplugging any controllers while playing resolves the issue entirely, but if you intend to play with a controller the issue must be resolved by saving and loading after it occurs.\r\n\r\nAll of the above is being brought up now for two important reasons: first, if you're using the Aspyr patch, you *must* apply the fix packages linked further down in this section for this build to function properly. And second, if your game version *isn't* using the Aspyr version, you need to decide whether or not you want it to be.\r\n\r\nUnlike the original KOTOR, where the widescreen application is so good that running it actually makes the game *more* stable, the same is very much not true of KOTOR 2. KOTOR 2's widescreen potential through UniWS is constrained to an extremely small number of resolutions, and the UniWS application for KOTOR 2 is extremely outdated, causing gradual save corruption and eventually wrecking the player's ability to load their saves. If that was gobbledygook to you, tl;dr *if you don't use the Aspyr patch, you can't apply widescreen to your game safely*. So even though it has some issues, if you either want widescreen support or to have controller support for your game and are not on GoG/Steam/Mac Appstore, you NEED to apply the Aspyr patch to your game copy. My personal recommendation, having played KOTOR 2 an embarassing 35+ times on the legacy version and a single time on the Aspyr version with J's fixes, is to use the Aspyr version if you can. No, it isn't perfect. But the better stability it affords is well worth the few annoying bugs it creates. If you want to use it, you can install it from the link provided by Tarhiel in [this thread on the GoG forums](https://www.gog.com/forum/star_wars_knights_of_the_old_republic_series/kotor_ii_drmfree_steam_update/post58). We've checked the files and confirmed that they are just a copy of the Aspyr patch: just extract the files and move them directly into your KOTOR 2 game folder, overwriting when prompted, and you will update your install to the Aspyr version.\r\n\r\nFor those who have the Aspyr patch installed, the below are the fixes which must be applied in order for this build to function normally:\r\n\r\n### 3C-FD Patcher\r\n\r\n**Name:** [3C-FD Patcher](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2734-fog-fix-more-3c-fd-patcher/)\r\n\r\n**Author:** J\r\n\r\n**Description:** Actual unadulterated black magic fuckery that fixes a huge number of the persistent and glaring problems of the Aspyr patch.\r\n\r\n**Category & Tier:** Bugfix, Graphics Improvement / 1 - Essential\r\n\r\n**Installation Method:** Executable\r\n\r\n:::warning\r\nCompatibility Warning\r\n:   If you didn't read the wall of text that preceded this mod, you can brick your entire install here. You'd seriously better not have just skipped straight here.\r\n\r\n    Ensure to only use this if on the most recent Steam/GoG patch, or if having manually applied the Aspyr patch to your game! Also ensure your executable is a fresh copy with no edits: it CANNOT have a 4GB/Large Address Aware patch already applied to it (this mod adds that patch). Finally, please note that **this mod cannot be utilized on the Mac Appstore version of the game**, since it doesn't launch via an executable; for Mac Appstore players, you will unfortunately need to play without these fixes. Since your games will not have the capacity to use 4GB of RAM, we recommend against utilizing the \"Ultimate\" series of upscales included later in this install, as a stability measure. Without the upscales, the Mac Appstore version should still be able to run the rest of the build without memory issues.\r\n    \r\n    When attempting to run this executable, Windows/your antivirus might attempt to block it, because it's an unsigned executable. The patch is made by a trusted member of the community, I have used it myself and can vouch for it, and the source code is publicly available [HERE](https://github.com/J0-o/3C-FD-Patcher)--please feel assured that this program is safe, and you can override Windows/your AV and run it. When running 3C-FD, select your game's executable and choose to apply all patches except the borderless windowed patch (this patch is not inherently incompatible with the builds, but because it is currently experimental I recommend not using it).\r\n:::\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Water Restoration\r\n\r\n**Name:** [Water Restoration](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2734-fog-fix-more-3c-fd-patcher/)\r\n\r\n**Author:** J\r\n\r\n**Description:** Restores many of the water effects which were removed with the Aspyr patch.\r\n\r\n**Category & Tier:** Bugfix, Graphics Improvement / 1 - Essential\r\n\r\n**Non-English Functionality:** YES\r\n\r\n**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod\r\n\r\n:::warning\r\nKnown Bugs\r\n:   This mod causes some strong light reflections below the grates on Citadel Station, but the mod author is looking into resolving this.\r\n:::\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Stutter Fix\r\n\r\n**Name:** [Stutter Fix and Force Cage Update](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2699-stutter-fix-and-force-cage-update/)\r\n\r\n**Author:** J\r\n\r\n**Description:** Inexplicably, Force cages were given certain water texture properties which caused them to generate horrid visual lag whenever the player's camera faced their direction.

epilogueContent = "## Enhanced Widescreen Support Mods\r\n\r\nAssuming that you are on the Aspyr patch of the game, the following mods can enhance your widescreen gameplay. These mods should *only* be installed if you are on the Aspyr patch; while as previously mentioned widescreen can technically be applied to a legacy KOTOR 2 installation independently of the Aspyr patch it is destabilizing to do so, and strongly recommended against when utilizing this guide.\r\n\r\n### Main Menu Fix\r\n\r\n**Name:** [Main Menu Fix for Widescreen](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1138-tsl-main-menu-model-fix-for-widescreen/)\r\n\r\n**Author:** DarthParametric\r\n\r\n**Description:** A fix for TSL's stretched menu when playing the game widescreen.\r\n\r\n**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement & Bugfix / 3 - Suggested\r\n\r\n**Non-English Functionality:** YES\r\n\r\n**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod\r\n\r\n:::note\r\nInstallation Instructions\r\n:   Apply the contents of the \"for override folder\".

This mod is by far the better of the two cutscene mods available, but if you're on limited data, a poor connection or have limited drive space, it's a much better idea to use naelavok's remastered cutscenes below rather than Pops's version here. If you've got the space and the speed, though, this is where it's at.\r\n\r\n**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 1 - Essential\r\n\r\n**Non-English Functionality:** YES\r\n\r\n**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod\r\n\r\n:::note\r\nDownload Instructions\r\n:   Choose the resolution option which most closely fits your monitor's screen size during the download process.

I would estimate around 8 hours, which is the typical time it takes for the native movies to be scaled to 1920x1080 using the same system, but remember that this would be a fully-automated process.\r\n:::\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### K2 Remastered Cutscenes\r\n\r\n**Name:** [KOTOR 2 Remastered Cutscenes](https://www.nexusmods.com/kotor2/mods/1066/)\r\n\r\n**Author:** naelavok\r\n\r\n**Description:** Using predictive AI, /u/naelavok has upscaled the cutscenes for both games out of their horrendous default resolution, to be much more crisp and viewable.

Basegame Issues & Fixes\r\n\r\n### Crash After Character Creation\r\n\r\nThis is a common issue which users tend to think is caused by the mod builds, but 99.9% of the time you don't have a mod error, and this is a basegame issue. Sometimes the game refuses to load when you have the Frame Buffer Effects setting enabled, so just disabling it in your Advanced Graphics Options ingame will allow you to load the game. This can also get you past loadscreen crashes that may rarely occur later in the game.\r\n\r\n### Character Stuck After Combat\r\n\r\nThis isn't a bug that modding can fix (or cause), it's an engine bug. It's related to the game's framerate being unsynced with your monitor's refresh rate. If you're on a 60hz monitor, you can just toggle v-sync. If you're 144hz or similar, you can either set your monitor to 60hz manually for the duration of play and also toggle v-sync, OR edit the game's .ini file to set the refresh rate setting to your monitor's refresh rate.\r\n\r\n### Swoop Racing\r\n\r\nAlthough I don't recommend staying in compatibility mode for Windows XP SP3 long-term, as it can exacerbate loadscreen crashes, sometimes swoop racing can mess up in a way that makes it necessary. If you find your swoop bike floating several meters off the track, exit the game and launch it in compatibility mode for XP SP3. You should be able to race normally, and you can turn off the compatibility mode after the racing segment is over.\r\n\r\n### Dialogue Skipping\r\n\r\nDialogue skipping is when an NPC's dialogue line is registered by the game, but jumped past immediately as it's switched to—you briefly see the subtitles, then they're gone with no other indication that character was speaking. I often get asked if this is a build problem, but it's not. The builds exacerbate it in some ways by adding more data to the game (it seems to be related to a memory leak in some way), but the biggest culprit by far is the Aspyr patch, though the issue can happen on any game version. Thankfully, with the 3C-FD patcher, this issue is basically no longer a problem--though bear in mind that it is different from the \"dialogue floatiness\" I describe in the section on the Aspyr section, and the input delay dialogue skipping with the Aspyr patch still exists. That issue is not related to a memory leak and is not consistent, however, as traditional dialogue skipping is.\r\n"

The bottom-line is that KOTOR 2's influence system is asinine, and major plot points are locked behind very high—or very low—influence with several companions. Your influence with companions is also extremely obfuscated, only really discernible by their LS/DS alignment relative to your alignment, but this is a very buggy system which breaks with high Charisma values on the player, or with certain feats. There is no other way ingame to tell what your influence is without this mod.

I don't like this any more than you probably do, but I still think having both the Handmaiden and Disciple is far superior to having only one of them, and I think it's an acceptable price for what the mod provides.\r\n\r\nThe mod gives you a stim to manage the Handmaiden and Disciple (spawning & despawning them) which you use to run the script. This stim appears in the *shields* quickbar at the bottom-left of the screen, however; be aware of this, since it doesn't show up in the normal stims category!"

If the file outputs \"Finished, Press any key to continue\" but does not list any files it deleted, it *is not working*, and if it does not work it *will* crash your game. You can try to resolve this by moving your Override folder to a different location (I recommend a subfolder in your Documents or Downloads directories), putting the .bat file there and running it through that directory, but if that doesn't work you will need to manually go through and delete the duplicates from the link above."

Description = "This mod is an upscale of virtually all NPC textures in the game, including aliens and some creatures. But that's not all—Rob is skilled with texture work, and although this package uses AI as a base, he's gone over it by hand and corrected, adjusted, and in some cases entirely retextured parts of the textures to eliminate hallucinations, burring or fuzziness, and preserve the original aesthetic of the texture. What's more, Rob's forte is modeling, and he's included a huge series of model adjustments and fixes along with this package which fixes various rendering issues. I can't recommend this package highly enough."
InstallationMethod = "Loose-File (with optional automation)"
Directions = "If you are on a system which can run .bat files, I *strongly* recommend using the automated system to deal with compatibility for this mod. To do so, first extract redrob's mod from its archive, then enter the \"TSL Optional Kreia Model\" folder, copy the four model files within, paste them into the \"Copy contents to TSL's Override folder\" and overwrite. After this, navigate to [this page](https://github.com/KOTOR-Community-Portal/mod-builds/blob/main/scripts/cleaner.bat) and click on the button with the arrow pointing down at the top of the code list (the one which says \"download raw file\"). Place cleaner.bat in the folder from redrob's mod called \"Copy contents to TSL's Override folder\", then go to [here](https://github.com/KOTOR-Community-Portal/mod-builds/blob/main/scripts/cleanlist_k2.txt) and repeat the same step, placing cleanlist_k2.txt in the same location. You can now run cleanlist.bat: follow the instructions onscreen, selecting whether you did or didn't use any of the given mods, and the batch file will automatically delete the incompatible files. Once you reach the end of the list, you can exit the .bat window, delete cleaner.bat and cleanlist_k1.txt, and then move the remaining files in the folder to your override.\r\n\r\n    If you cannot run .bat files or feel uncomfortable running this file, you will need to manually delete the files yourself, following the instructions [here](https://github.com/KOTOR-Community-Portal/mod-builds/blob/main/content/k2/redrob_deletionsk2.md)."
