For unknown reasons, KOTOR 2 did away with this differentiation and gave every class a 1:1 ratio. This mod reverts this, giving classes which aren't explicitly melee-focused the 1.25:1 ratio back, restoring a bit of difficulty to what is otherwise a *very* easy game."

Tier = "4 - Optional"
Description = "This is going to require a bit of an explanation. I personally believe this mod breaks immersion—so why add it? The bottom-line is that KOTOR 2's influence system is asinine, and major plot points are locked behind very high—or very low—influence with several companions. Your influence with companions is also extremely obfuscated, only really discernible by their LS/DS alignment relative to your alignment, but this is a very buggy system which breaks with high Charisma values on the player, or with certain feats. There is no other way ingame to tell what your influence is without this mod. I mark it as optional because it *does* break immersion, but for many players I think having a system to determine influence will be extremely important for enjoyment of the story."

You can experience all their content and use them both throughout the entire campaign, as was originally intended by Obsidian.\r\n\r\nBe aware, however, that PartySwap *does* require some fourth wall-breaking elements, including the need to use a script and dialogue window to summon the Handmaiden in order for its party trickery to work. I don't like this any more than you probably do, but I still think having both the Handmaiden and Disciple is far superior to having only one of them, and I think it's an acceptable price for what the mod provides.\r\n\r\nThe mod gives you a stim to manage the Handmaiden and Disciple (spawning & despawning them) which you use to run the script. This stim appears in the *shields* quickbar at the bottom-left of the screen, however; be aware of this, since it doesn't show up in the normal stims category!"

This is a comprehensive and *incredibly* professional rework of the ending sequence of KOTOR 2. TSLRCM is famous for tightening the ending up, but it still leaves several plot holes flapping in the wind--how does Malachor get destroyed in an LS ending if HK-47 is never rebuilt and G0-T0 isn't stopped? Why does the Exile have to preserve Malachor if they're DS? How is the party saved? What next? None of these questions are answered, but WildKarrde's mod not only answers them all, it does it with an incredible level of professionalism which makes it feel like it was content straight-up made by Obsidian, on a level more seamless than even restored content from TSLRCM often achieves."

This mod is an upscale of virtually all NPC textures in the game, including aliens and some creatures. But that's not all—Rob is skilled with texture work, and although this package uses AI as a base, he's gone over it by hand and corrected, adjusted, and in some cases entirely retextured parts of the textures to eliminate hallucinations, burring or fuzziness, and preserve the original aesthetic of the texture. What's more, Rob's forte is modeling, and he's included a huge series of model adjustments and fixes along with this package which fixes various rendering issues. I can't recommend this package highly enough."

After this, navigate to [this page](https://github.com/KOTOR-Community-Portal/mod-builds/blob/dev/scripts/cleaner.bat) and click on the button with the arrow pointing down at the top of the code list (the one which says \"download raw file\"). Place cleaner.bat in the folder from redrob's mod called \"Copy contents to TSL's Override folder\", then go to [here](https://github.com/KOTOR-Community-Portal/mod-builds/blob/dev/scripts/cleanlist_k2.txt) and repeat the same step, placing cleanlist_k2.txt in the same location. You can now run cleanlist.bat: follow the instructions onscreen, selecting whether you did or didn't use any of the given mods, and the batch file will automatically delete the incompatible files. Once you reach the end of the list, you can exit the .bat window, delete cleaner.bat and cleanlist_k1.txt, and then move the remaining files in the folder to your override.\r\n\r\nIf you cannot run .bat files or feel uncomfortable running this file, you will need to manually delete the files yourself, following the instructions [here](https://github.com/KOTOR-Community-Portal/mod-builds/blob/dev/content/k2/redrob_deletionsk2.md)."

Not only have they split the blade texture in two to allow for lightsabers with cores of a different color (currently unsupported in the build release, but hopefully coming soon), they've also added dynamic reflections to each and every lightsaber across almost every area of the game. When you're fighting a Dark Jedi, you're going to see your faces bathed in shifting colors, fading and brightening as you swing your lightsabers; when you ignite your saber in a hallway, it will reflect on the floor and walls, and will realistically increase in intensity as the blade draws nearer to the surface. This is an incredible project, and easily one of the most important--and impressive--mods ever released for KOTOR. In the next few years, it could completely change the face of lightsaber modding."

Author = "Leilukin, original mod made by felixfelicitas"
Description = "In KotOR II: TSL, players are given options to set Revan's gender and alignment during the first conversation with Atton on Peragus. However, the game always assumes a male Revan is romantically involved with Bastila, while female Revan is romantically involved with Carth.\r\n\r\nIn March 2015, felixfelicitas released his Alternate Revan Romances mod to remedy that problem. His mod allowed players to set Revan's love interest(s), or lack thereof, and the rest of the game will have different variations of dialogue to reflect that change. Most notably, Bastila can be chosen as female Revan's love interest, and Carth can be chosen as male Revan's love interest.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the original mod also had multiple bugs, including game-breaking ones. After becoming a modder myself, I had been trying to fix the bugs with felixfelicitas' mod, and was eventually successful. With felixfelicitas' permission, I release this updated version of the Alternate Revan Romances mod."

Therefore, with this mod, female Exiles are also able to enjoy the same Visas scene as male Exiles do, including the romance.\r\n\r\nOriginally, Visas mentions the Handmaiden when she confesses her feelings for the Exile. This mod also checks if the Handmaiden joins your party to that particular dialogue, so with this mod, if you never recruited Handmaiden, Visas will not mention her.\r\n\r\nThis mod also provides an additional component to make Kreia reference the Exile’s interest in Visas, regardless of the Exile’s gender, during the player’s conversation with Kreia."
