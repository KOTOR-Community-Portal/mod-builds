The goal is to ensure that companions' statlines are not only thematically consistent, but also broadly mechanically balanced, to better-incentivize the use of under-utilized party members.\r\n\r\nSome information has been censored to prevent spoilers.",

In KOTOR 2, companions have [influence](/faq/k2.html#How_does_KOTOR_2's_influence_system_work)—a mechanic by which the player character can influence their allies, either to align with their views or grow hostile to them. Sadly, KOTOR 2's influence system is asinine. Major plot points are locked behind very high—or very low—influence with several companions. Your influence with companions is also extremely obfuscated, only really discernible by a companion's LS/DS alignment relative to your alignment, but this is a very buggy system which breaks with high Charisma values on the player, or with certain feats. There is no other way ingame to tell what your influence is without this mod. I mark it as optional because it *does* break immersion, but for many players I think having a system to determine influence will be extremely important for enjoyment of the story.",

      "description": "You'll eventually encounter a salvager who needs to be saved. While you *can* just opt to kill him, if you're not a psychopath you can choose to save him. But this is a mistake. He has pathfinding so bad it would make the worst escort quest target in history blush in embarassment. This mod by Ozils is an outright lifesaver, applying much-enhanced follower logic to the salvager and automatically teleporting him to the party if you get too far away, so you can guide him to where he needs to go very easily.",

What's more, he's made this mod compatible with JC's lightsaber visual effects above, and also added Crazy34's lightsaber reflections to his sabers, so your (and enemy!) lightsabers will dynamically reflect off of nearby surfaces. The model differentiations here aren't groundbreaking, but they're better than vanilla where all the sabers are entirely the same, especially when you see just how great the reflections look ingame.",

It does work differently and can be used standalone (I actively recommend using it even if you choose not to use SAwL), but for the most part it is basically a realism/difficulty enhancement to SAwL. It enhances realism by adding a stealth feature to the same challenge which is modified in SAwL, gives the challenge certain Sneak Attack feats (they should logically have had these), and also forces the player and party to actively roll Awareness to detect the threats. This might sound like, combined with SAwL, it would be insane--and, normally, it would be. I recommend using the reduced difficulty option in this mod so you can have the realism without an unsurvivable difficulty spike.",

I typically don't like these mods, not because I disagree with the premise but because I tend to balk at +10 WIS modifiers on starting gear. Ol' Cappy, in my opinion, does it right here—these are unique clothes for most of the human companions which don't give insane bonuses, but instead small, rational, and most importantly balanced, lore-friendly and internally-consistent bonuses. These items are never going to be the best your team can get, but they are flavorful additions which will let you keep them in their default get a bit longer, if you so choose.",

They basically only exist to make things worse. This mod by Morty gives those feats a clear niche: now, instead of impacting companions' alignment directly, it impacts it indirectly by tripling the effects of any influence gain or loss.",

Why is it that, if you've fallen to the absolute depth of the Dark Side, you can throw lightning no more powerful than when you were first beginning to fall? Why is it that, as a paragon of the Light, the strength of your connections changes nothing about the power of the Force you can use to defend yourself? Well, now it does. Be an enlightened Jedi with mighty buffs that last an extended duration, or a fierce Sith Lord whose lightnings are easy to cast and mercilessly damaging. But better still, this mod isn't about a power fantasy—there are consequences that come from aligning strongly with one side, leading to atrophied abilities from the other extreme. It's a well-thought-out design that is well-balanced and feels great ingame while also being logically consistent. In my view, that makes this mod a must-have.",
