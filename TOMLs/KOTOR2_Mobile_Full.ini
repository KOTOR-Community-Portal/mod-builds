Name=Mobile TSLRCM (The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod)
Author=zbyl2, DarthStoney, Hassat Hunter & VarsityPuppet
Description=The whole reason why you would mod KOTOR 2, the legendary mod that includes bugfixes, restored content, and altered scenes to return the game to what it was meant to be. This mod isn't just essential—it's mandatory.
Category=Bugfix,Immersion,Mechanics Change,Restored Content
Tier=1 - Essential
Language=YES, *but* you must install the version of MTSLRCM which corresponds to your language of choice.
ModLinkFilenames=https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1801-mobile-restored-content-mod-mtslrcm/
Directions=For now, disregard the installation instructions included in the mod, as we will be dragging over the completed installation in batch. Once the mod is downloaded, extract it to a location of your choice on your PC/Mac and delete everything inside the dlc folder except for the 'mods_*x*' directory, the 'x' corresponding to your language of choice.\n\nYou now need to download [this file](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1321-kotor-2-editable-executable/) and place it within your mods_*x* folder. **This file is critical for future installations to function properly**. This is a dummy .exe file which lets later mods install to the right place on your device, and without error. We will delete it as one of the final steps of this installation process, as it's only needed for installations to function normally.\n\nFrom this point forward all mods are installed as if the mods_*x* folder is the **main game directory**. For any TSLPatcher executable which asks you to select the main game folder/folder with the executable in it, you will select the mods_*x* folder. Similarly, any mods directing you to place their files within the game's override folder will be placed within the override folder within mods_*x*.

Directions=Don't use the complete installer, instead selecting the individual component installer—this is *critical* for compatibility, not just to choose specific options. The installer for this mod will need to be run 7 times, once to install each of the options we'll be using: Kaevee Removal Parts 1 & 2, Saedhe's Head, Atton at the End, Kreia-Atris Dialogue Tweak, Trayus Mandalore Conversation, and Trayus Sith Lord Masks.

Name=Silent Sion Restoration
Author=Emperor Devon
Description=Another TSLRCM change I am not personally thrilled with—when Sion encounters the Exile for the first time in TSLRCM on the *Harbinger*, he speaks to them a line of warning. That engagement takes so much tension out of the scene, and this mod reverts it to the vanilla standard: when Sion appears at the end of the hall he only slowly walks towards the party, threatening and menacing.

Name=Thematic KOTOR 2 Companions
Author=Sniggles & JCarter426
Description=In the original KOTOR, BioWare did a few wacky things with character progression. Obsidian, not wanting to be outdone, decided to be even worse by just straight-up copying the statlines of several KOTOR companions for KOTOR 2 companions!

As part of the Thematic series of mods by JC and myself, Thematic KOTOR 2 Companions is a rework of companion starting attributes, skills, feats and powers to lock all companions into having the exact amount of bonuses they should for their level, as well as retuning several of their setups to more closely match the characters' behaviors and backstories. The goal is to ensure that companions' statlines are not only thematically consistent, but also broadly mechanically balanced, to better-incentivize the use of under-utilized party members.

Name=Classic Class Attack Bonus
Author=Crimson Knight
Description=In the original KOTOR, Soldier and Guardian classes had a 1:1 attack bonus; for every one level, they gained +1 attack. For every other class, this ratio was 1.25:1, which made classes feel different ingame and contributed to a difficulty scale. For unknown reasons, KOTOR 2 did away with this differentiation and gave every class a 1:1 ratio. This mod reverts this, giving classes which aren't explicitly melee-focused the 1.25:1 ratio back, restoring a bit of difficulty to what is otherwise a *very* easy game.

Name=Remote Tells Influence
Author=tk102, patch by Leilukin
Description=This is going to require a bit of an explanation. I personally believe this mod breaks immersion—so why add it? The bottom-line is that KOTOR 2's influence system is asinine, and major plot points are locked behind very high—or very low—influence with several companions. Your influence with companions is also extremely obfuscated, only really discernible by their LS/DS alignment relative to your alignment, but this is a very buggy system which breaks with high Charisma values on the player, or with certain feats. There is no other way ingame to tell what your influence is without this mod. I mark it as optional because it *does* break immersion, but for many players I think having a system to determine influence will be extremely important for enjoyment of the story.

Description=I'm betting that *anyone* who has played KOTOR 2 before will remember that fucking son of a bitch Czerka salvager in the Telos military base. His pathfinding would make the most awful escort quest target in history blush in embarassment. This mod by Ozils is an outright lifesaver, applying much-enhanced follower logic to the salvager and automatically teleporting him to the party if you get too far away. No more 20 minutes of painstakingly dragging his ass through the base!

I **strongly** recommend the 1k version for mobile devices; it will be hard to see the full benefit of the 2k version on a mobile device, the 2k version is a much larger filesize, and the larger texture size could interfere with module loading on the mobile version.

Name=PartySwap
Author=DarthTyren & Leilukin
Description=PartySwap is a legendary mod, and one of the best ever made for KOTOR 2. Through some unobtrusive scripting magic, it allows you to bring both the Disciple and Handmaiden with you as companions simultaneously, without removing another companion from the party wheel. You can experience all their content and use them both throughout the entire campaign, as was originally intended by Obsidian.

Be aware, however, that PartySwap *does* require some fourth wall-breaking elements, including the need to use a script and dialogue window to summon the Handmaiden in order for its party trickery to work. I don't like this any more than you probably do, but I still think having both the Handmaiden and Disciple is far superior to having only one of them, and I think it's an acceptable price for what the mod provides.

The mod gives you a stim to manage the Handmaiden and Disciple (spawning & despawning them) which you use to run the script. This stim appears in the *shields* quickbar at the bottom-left of the screen, however; be aware of this, since it doesn't show up in the normal stims category!

Name=True Sith Assassins
Author=offthegridmorty
Description=By default, Sith Assassins aren't *actually* using stealth, and you don't *actually* roll Awareness to detect them. This mod not only gives the Sith Assassins some levels of Sneak Attack (they are literally stealthed assassins, after all) it also makes them actually use stealth just like the player would, and the party either needs to damage them or roll a successful Awareness check to detect them. As you may expect, this mod can be *hard* depending upon your character build, and also whether you're using Sith Assassins with Lightsabers. It does have an option to reduce the difficulty, though, which makes it more immersive and less about you getting your shit kicked in, if that's appealing to you.

Description=Giving companions a unique version of their default clothes so they can keep their 'standard' look throughout the entire game while still having mechanically powerful equipment is a very common mod type. I typically don't like these mods, not because I disagree with the premise but because I tend to balk at +10 WIS modifiers on starting gear. Ol' Cappy, in my opinion, does it right here—these are unique clothes for most of the human companions which don't give insane bonuses, but instead small, rational, and most importantly balanced, lore-friendly and internally-consistent bonuses. These items are never going to be the best your team can get, but they are flavorful additions which will let you keep them in their default get a bit longer, if you so choose.

Author=offthegridmorty
Description=Light Side Enlightenment (not to be confused with the Force power Enlightenment) and Dark Side Corruption, the bonus feats given to Jedi Master and Sith Lord prestige classes, are really bad. Not only do they only impact a companion's alignment (which is rarely of use to the player), they are also buggy and can overflow, flinging the companion to the complete opposite alignment than they should be! They basically only exist to make things worse. This mod by Morty gives those feats a clear niche: now, instead of impacting companions' alignment directly, it impacts it indirectly by tripling the effects of any influence gain or loss.

Name=Alignment Affects Force Powers
Author=offthegridmorty
Description=Just like its companion mod for KOTOR, this mod is *badass*. Why is it that, if you've fallen to the absolute depth of the Dark Side, you can throw lightning no more powerful than when you were first beginning to fall? Why is it that, as a paragon of the Light, the strength of your connections changes nothing about the power of the Force you can use to defend yourself? Well, now it does. Be an enlightened Jedi with mighty buffs that last an extended duration, or a fierce Sith Lord whose lightnings are easy to cast and mercilessly damaging. But better still, this mod isn't about a power fantasy—there are consequences that come from aligning strongly with one side, leading to atrophied abilities from the other extreme. It's a well-thought-out design that is well-balanced and feels great ingame while also being logically consistent. In my view, that makes this mod a must-have.

Description=This is a script written by Flachzangen which allows you to remove duplicate .TGA or .TPC files in your game directory.

If you are on a Mac or other device that cannot run .bat files and the bash script is not an option for you to use, a list of all the files you will need to manually delete can be found [here](/modding/mod_builds/k1/delete.html).\n\n**MAKE SURE THIS SCRIPT RUNS PROPERLY!** On some operating systems, overzealous antivirus setups, or filepaths with particular characters in them it may fail. If the file outputs "Finished, Press any key to continue" but does not list any files it deleted, it *is not working*, and if it does not work it *will* crash your game. You can try to resolve this by moving your Override folder to a different location (I recommend a subfolder in your Documents or Downloads directories), putting the .bat file there and running it through that directory, but if that doesn't work you will need to manually go through and delete the duplicates from the link above.
