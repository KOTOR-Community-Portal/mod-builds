Guid: 576bc34e-5f5a-4a45-a78d-0f31c2032abd
Name: KOTOR Dialogue Fixes
Author: Salk & Kainzorus Prime
Description: In addition to fixing several typos, this mod takes the PC's dialogue—which is written in such a way as to make the PC sound constantly shocked, stupid, or needlessly evil—and replaces it with more moderate and reasonable responses, even for DS choices.
Category:
- Immersion
Tier: 1 - Essential
IsSelected: true
Directions: The choice of which version to use is up to you; I recommend PC Response Moderation, as in vanilla your character sounds like a giddy little schoolchild following even the most minor dialogue interactions, and that mod serves to correct that without actually changing the underlying dialogue much, but if you prefer only bugfixes that option is compatible. Just move your chosen dialog.tlk file to the *main game directory* (where the executable would normally be)—in this very specific case, NOT the override.

Name: Thematic KOTOR Companions
Author: Sniggles & JCarter426
Description: >-
  BioWare did a few wacky things with character progression in this game. To an extent that's novel, since it helps make companions feel more unique and less rigidly tied to the D&D system if they can be stronger than what the system otherwise allows. But it becomes less novel when you realize that most of what they did is just make Jedi companions super OP and short most other party members on stats & feats they should have had.


  As part of the Thematic series of mods by JC and myself, Thematic KOTOR Companions is a rework of companion starting attributes, skills, feats and powers to lock all companions into having the exact amount of bonuses they should for their level, as well as retuning several of their setups to more closely match the characters' behaviors and backstories. The goal is to ensure that companions' statlines are not only thematically consistent, but also broadly mechanically balanced, to better-incentivize the use of under-utilized party members.


  Companion names, genders, and some information about their backstories have been censored in the attached changes breakdown to avoid spoilers.

Name: KOTOR Community Patch
Author: Various Authors; Darth Parametric, JCarter426 & A Future Pilot Collate
Description: >-
  An ambitious compilation intending to be a comprehensive bugfix mod for the original game, the KOTOR Community Patch combines hundreds of various fixes and improvements from over a dozen other mods, as well as fixes put together by AFP, DP and JC on their own. With bugfixes as important to KOTOR as TSLRCM's are to KOTOR 2, I can't recommend its use highly enough.


  Please make sure to **NOT READ** the list of changes included within the mod, however; due to its size and composite nature, I can't censor information for the whole thing, and there's a lot of spoilers in it if you read the readme fully!

Name: JC's Jedi Tailor
Author: JCarter426
Description: It's very annoying when you've got your party together and you want to show your swag off with color-coordinated outfits, but the game only gives you gaudy blue robes. Worry no longer! JC has given us a solution in the form of a skilled Trandoshan tailor, who will dye your robes on demand—it's also compatible with Cloaked Jedi Robes! He even has some very well-written and lore-friendly dialogue about current events.

Name: Unique Sith Governor
Author: N-DReW25
Description: >-
  This is a mod I specifically requested because, by default, a certain Sith Governor you encounter uses the same model and texture as many other Sith in the game. I felt that visually differentiating them a bit would make the other Sith seem more unique by comparison, and thus this mod.

Name: Sith Uniform Reformation Revised
Author: Heyorange, Sith Holocron, JCarter426
Description: If you ever want a window into incredibly minor things that I think are really cool, this is the cream of the crop. Vanilla KOTOR doesn't really have much rhyme or reason behind differentiating the appearance of the Sith soldiers you encounter, except for rule of cool. This mod makes the clothing of each rank clear and consistent, with an established breakdown of epaulettes, as well as rank and regiment insignias. New, and thanks to Sith Holocron, these textures have also been further enhanced and upscaled to match the rest of the vanilla game's upscales present in the mod builds.

Guid: faa8d1c9-f57b-4b87-bb08-78fdc5530632
Name: New Lightsaber Blade Models
Author: Crazy34
Description: With this mod, Crazy34 walked into the community, slammed down one of the most impressive mods ever made for this game, and dared us to do better. Not only have they split the blade texture in two to allow for lightsabers with cores of a different color (currently unsupported in the build release, but hopefully coming soon), they've also added *dynamic reflections* to each and every lightsaber across every area of the game. When you're fighting a Dark Jedi, you're going to see your faces bathed in shifting colors, fading and brightening as you swing your lightsabers; when you ignite your saber in a hallway, it will reflect on the floor and walls, and will realistically increase in intensity as the blade draws nearer to the surface. This is an incredible project, and easily one of the most important—and impressive—mods ever released for KOTOR. In the next few years, it could completely change the face of lightsaber modding.

Description: Most of the Twi'lek textures used in the game are very samey, ultimately boiling down to just a few alternate textures. This mod makes use of alternate textures created as a modder's resource to significantly differentiate the appearances of many unique Twi'lek NPCs.

Directions: Run the installer first. Once completed, move the upscaled textures to override (if desired). If using the original necks option of Ashton Scorpius's Better Twi'lek Males mod, also ensure to move the files in the "Optional - Original Necks" folder. If using the Senni Vek Mod, ensure to also re-run the installer and select the compatibility patch (use the patch for Senni Vek Restoration, NOT Senni Vek's Ambush; that is a different mod version).

Description: >-
  The definition of modding hubris. When the power to change the universe at the tips of one's fingers leads a man to spend more time making a mod than the combined thousands of users who ever download it will even see what he did on screen.


  There's a wrong soundset. This mod fixes it. The character dies about 5 seconds later. To even download this mod is to question one's sanity.

Name: Swoop Bike Upgrades
Author: Salk
Description: "Originally, swoop bikes in KOTOR were intended to have upgrades available for purchase which would modify their performance to make winning races easier. This mod restores two upgrades to the game: one that reduces the speed loss taken when hitting an obstacle, and one which increases acceleration. Right now this mod isn't a perfect implementation of what I'd like, including too few upgrades which are a bit pricey relative to the benefit they give, but I still think it's better for players to have the option to use them than not."

Name: Vision Enhancement
Author: JCarter426
Description: In the course of the game, the player character has several Force-influenced visions. There were some problems with these by default, though, namely that they always happened on your ship (even before you get your ship!), and your character will wear whatever clothes they currently have equipped to bed, even if it's heavy armor. This mod fixes both oversights.

Description: Pazaak (basically blackjack with bonus cards) in the original KOTOR features AI that cheat, badly. While there's no way to prevent the computer from favoring NPCs in draws, there is a way to drastically reduce their ability to help themselves, and that's to give them all decks one tier lower than what their difficulty says they should have.

Name: Ebon Hawk Camera Replacement
Author: LDR
Description: By default, the camera angle inside the *Ebon Hawk* is ridiculously close to the PC, which not only makes the PC take up the majority of the screen, it also makes it very hard to see around you. This mod replaces the *Ebon Hawk* camera angle with one closer to the camera angles present in the rest of the game, and similar to KOTOR 2's *Ebon Hawk* camera angle.

Description: In the base-game, grenades typically aren't very useful after the first few planets, once Force powers and the PC's combat capabilities begin to spin up. This mod seeks not only to increase the value of grenades throughout the game but to also make the enemies wielding them more dangerous by tying the total damage output of a grenade to the demolitions stat of the thrower.

Author: WildKarrde
Description: There are many companion dialogues that, in vanilla, can only happen if you bring both the relevant companions to the overworld and run around with them for a bit. In this mod, Wildkarrde borrows a bit from how KOTOR 2 handles companion interactions by allowing many of these dialogues to occur on the your ship, so you won't miss the unique interactions even if you don't use the companions in question.

Name: "JC's Romance Enhancement: Dark Sacrifice"
Author: JCarter426
Description: "In vanilla, with some small variation KOTOR has a binary ending: Light Side or Dark Side. But it wasn't always so—until quite late in development a very unique ending for Dark Side players who romanced Carth, one of your first companions, was still being developed, and voice lines were even recorded for it. For unknown reasons this ending was cut, but with this mod it has now been restored. You are not locked into this alternate ending, it's only presented as an option which your character may choose. More than this can't be revealed to avoid spoilers, but do note that unless you intend to play as a DS character capable of romancing Carth, this mod will not present any changes. Please also note, in vanilla only females can romance Carth, but a third-party mod by Leilukin not present in this guide makes Carth able to be romanced by male characters, and is compatible with this mod."

Name: Saber Throw Knockdown Effect
Author: uwadmin12
Description: By default, the "Throw Lightsaber" power is a little weak. Not only does it seem like it takes forever, it does much less damage in a much smaller AoE than other powers available to the party Jedi! The goal of this mod is giving Advanced Throw Lightsaber some additional functionality that makes using it worthwhile, namely the inclusion of a knockdown effect on the primary target if that target fails to pass a saving throw. This can make the ability useful for screening particular zones while also dealing damage—still somewhat less effective than most other powers, but with more guaranteed damage.

Name: PC Dialogue with Davik's Slave Change
Author: Leilukin
Description: "2003 was a different time, but this mod *really* proves that. In vanilla, if you request a 'massage' from some slaves—which has some sexual implications in Star Wars—you get nothing more than a disgusted remark from some companions. You can even threaten them without consequence. This mod properly amends this, giving you two options: for those deeply bothered by the ability to take advantage of the slaves the option to pressure them into servicing you can be removed entirely, whereas the second retains the massage, but gives Dark Side points for requesting it, as well as adding DS points for threatening the slaves at any point."
