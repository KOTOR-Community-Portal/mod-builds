The bottom-line is that KOTOR 2's influence system is asinine, and major plot points are locked behind very high--or very low--influence with several companions. Your influence with companions is also extremely obfuscated, only really discernible by their LS/DS alignment relative to your alignment, but this is a very buggy system which breaks with high Charisma values on the player, or with certain feats. There is no other way ingame to tell what your influence is without this mod. I mark it as optional because it does break immersion, but for many players I think having a system to determine influence will be extremely important for enjoyment of the story."

You can experience all their content and use them both throughout the entire campaign, as was originally intended by Obsidian.\r\n\r\nBe aware, however, that PartySwap does require some fourth wall-breaking elements, including the need to use a script and dialogue window to summon the Handmaiden in order for its party trickery to work. I don't like this any more than you probably do, but I still think having both the Handmaiden and Disciple is far superior to having only one of them, and I think it's an acceptable price for what the mod provides.\r\n\r\nThe mod gives you a stim to manage the Handmaiden and Disciple (spawning & despawning them) which you use to run the script. This stim appears in the shields quickbar at the bottom-left of the screen, however; be aware of this, since it doesn't show up in the normal stims category!"

Files with the .TPC filetype take priority, so for several of the patches we've downloaded which are of the .tga filetype, we need to delete any .TPC duplicates in order to get them to read properly. That's what this script will do. It is **CRITICAL** to use this script, as, if .tpc files take priority in some instances, the game will crash."

If the file outputs \"Finished, Press any key to continue\" but does not list any files it deleted, it *is not working*, and if it does not work it *will* crash your game. You can try to resolve this by moving your Override folder to a different location (I recommend a subfolder in your Documents or Downloads directories), putting the .bat file there and running it through that directory, but if that doesn't work you will need to manually go through and delete the duplicates from the link above."
