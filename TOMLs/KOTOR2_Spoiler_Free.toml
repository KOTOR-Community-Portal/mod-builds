preambleContent = "# KOTOR 2 Spoiler-Free Build: Mobile Version\r\n\r\n## Installation Notes\r\n\r\n:::warning\r\nImportant\r\n:   If you were linked to this list directly without reading the install instructions, please go back and read them [here](/modding/mod_builds)! There are several critical setup and general best-practice steps you need to be aware of before beginning the install process. The instructions for how this list is installed are located on that page, not this build!\r\n:::\r\n\r\nAlthough this is a mobile-compatible build, due to required compatibility tools we must use to get this build working, you will need to install all mods to a 'dummy directory' on your PC or Mac *first*, then move that completed package over all at once to your phone in order for the builds to apply properly. This means you **MUST** have a PC or Mac in order to utilize this build for mobile, although you **CAN** install just [MTSLRCM](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1801-mobile-restored-content-mod-mtslrcm/) (the mobile version of The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod) with just your mobile device.\r\n\r\n### Install Computer Instructions\r\n\r\nIt is critical to ensure that you only have **ONE** installation of KOTOR on your device before beginning the installation process. If you have multiple installations, or even just two game executables in different locations, mod installers which are set up to auto-detect your game's installation directory *will* misidentify which one is correct and install the mods wherever they please, probably spiking your whole install in the process. For the sake of stability: if you have a copy of KOTOR 2 installed on your device already, compress it to an archive using a program like WinRAR or 7zip, and delete the loose files left over. Then, when the install process is completed, extract the archive where the previous install was located and your local game will be preserved.\r\n\r\nDo not, under **ANY CIRCUMSTANCES**, run a TSLPatcher or HoloPatcher executable from within a file archive (IE a compressed file like a .rar, .zip, .7z, etc). You *must* extract all archives before installing mod content, or running an executable. Failure to extract before installing will break your game. Also, ensure you don't extract installer-based mods to the same folder. If, for example, you extract every single mod to a folder called \"KOTOR Mods\", each time you extract you'll be overwriting critical data from the previous mods. Make sure each installer-based mod is extracted to its own folder before running the installer.\r\n\r\nPlease also bear in mind: if you are asked to direct a TSLPatcher executable to a folder to begin install, that folder should ALWAYS be your 'dummy directory', the folder which contains the KOTOR 2 editable executable, which you will put together during the TSLRCM installation step. For mods that are NOT installed with the TSLPatcher, *unless otherwise noted* their loose-file contents are placed directly in the Override directory. Unless you are following specific instructions (the mod author's or my own) that state otherwise, you should not be placing files directly in the dummy directory. You should *never* have any subfolders inside the Modules or Override folders within the dummy directory.\r\n\r\nAs a final note, be aware that the TSLPatcher executable utilized in the installation process of many of these mods (frustratingly) does not always function on multi-monitor setups. If you have more than one monitor on the system which you're using to install mods, you may need to disable your second while installing.\r\n\r\n### Mac OS Users\r\n\r\nIt is *required* to be able to run executable files in order to install this list. A wrapper program like Wineskin or some other option which will allow you to run executable files is necessary in order to proceed.\r\n\r\n### Known Bugs\r\n\r\n* There are significant camera angle errors in a certain ingame cutscene late in the game, when a Republic ship is approaching Telos--you'll know it when you get there. We currently don't know why this is and are looking into it actively. The scene still plays properly, including audible dialogue, the camera simply doesn't face the proper direction when doing so."
epilogueContent = "## IMPORTANT: Final Installation Instructions\r\n\r\nFirst, navigate to mods_english's override directory, locate, and delete two files, if they're present: \"CM_baremetal.tga\" and \"CM_baremetal.txi\".\r\n\r\nOnce that's completed, if you did not complete the case sensitivity step, delete the dummy executable file in mods_english which you downloaded at the beginning of the process now. Your install is now complete! You can now connect your mobile device to your system, and move the dlc folder containing the mods_english folder to the install point for your device:\r\n\r\n**iOS**:\r\nOn iOS, they are placed in iTunes > Apps > Documents, in the same spot that the ‘saves’ folder goes.\r\n\r\n**ANDROID**:\r\nOn Android the files should be placed in /Home/Android/data/com.aspyr.swkotor2/files/\r\n"

In KOTOR 2, companions have [influence](/faq/k2#How_does_KOTOR_2s_influence_system_work)—a mechanic by which the player character can influence their allies, either to align with their views or grow hostile to them. Sadly, KOTOR 2's influence system is asinine. Major plot points are locked behind very high—or very low—influence with several companions. Your influence with companions is also extremely obfuscated, only really discernible by a companion's LS/DS alignment relative to your alignment, but this is a very buggy system which breaks with high Charisma values on the player, or with certain feats. There is no other way ingame to tell what your influence is without this mod. I mark it as optional because it *does* break immersion, but for many players I think having a system to determine influence will be extremely important for enjoyment of the story."

I should stress that this is only included because I find it to be fitting regardless of gender, and hold this character's expression of feelings as plot-relevant."

It enhances realism by adding a stealth feature to the same challenge which is modified in SAwL, gives the challenge certain Sneak Attack feats (they should logically have had these), and also forces the player and party to actively roll Awareness to detect the threats. This might sound like, combined with SAwL, it would be insane--and, normally, it would be. I recommend using the reduced difficulty option in this mod so you can have the realism without an unsurvivable difficulty spike."

I typically don't like these mods, not because I disagree with the premise but because I tend to balk at +10 WIS modifiers on starting gear. Ol' Cappy, in my opinion, does it right here—these are unique clothes for most of the human companions which don't give insane bonuses, but instead small, rational, and most importantly balanced, lore-friendly and internally-consistent bonuses. These items are never going to be the best your team can get, but they are flavorful additions which will let you keep them in their default get a bit longer, if you so choose."

The bonuses for two of these specific classes, Light Side Enlightenment and Dark Side Corruption, are really bad. Not only do they only impact a companion's alignment (which is rarely of use to the player), they are also buggy and can overflow, flinging the companion to the complete opposite alignment than they should be! They basically only exist to make things worse. This mod by Morty gives those feats a clear niche: now, instead of impacting companions' alignment directly, it impacts it indirectly by tripling the effects of any influence gain or loss."
