In KOTOR 2, companions have [influence](/faq/k2.html#How_does_KOTOR_2's_influence_system_work)—a mechanic by which the player character can influence their allies, either to align with their views or grow hostile to them. Sadly, KOTOR 2's influence system is asinine. Major plot points are locked behind very high—or very low—influence with several companions. Your influence with companions is also extremely obfuscated, only really discernible by a companion's LS/DS alignment relative to your alignment, but this is a very buggy system which breaks with high Charisma values on the player, or with certain feats. There is no other way ingame to tell what your influence is without this mod. I mark it as optional because it *does* break immersion, but for many players I think having a system to determine influence will be extremely important for enjoyment of the story."

This might sound like, combined with SAwL, it would be insane--and, normally, it would be.

If the file outputs \"Finished, Press any key to continue\" but does not list any files it deleted, it *is not working*, and if it does not work it *will* crash your game. You can try to resolve this by moving your Override folder to a different location (I recommend a subfolder in your Documents or Downloads directories), putting the .bat file there and running it through that directory, but if that doesn't work you will need to manually go through and delete the duplicates from the link above."

Description = "Redrob is a quiet legend within the scene, who disappears for years and pops back up with projects nobody expects but which become instant classics. Welcome to the latest. This mod is an upscale of virtually all NPC textures in the game, including aliens and some creatures. But that's not all—Rob is skilled with texture work, and although this package uses AI as a base, he's gone over it by hand and corrected, adjusted, and in some cases entirely retextured parts of the textures to eliminate hallucinations, burring or fuzziness, and preserve the original aesthetic of the texture. What's more, Rob's forte is modeling, and he's included a huge series of model adjustments and fixes along with this package which fixes various rendering issues. I can't recommend this package highly enough."
InstallationMethod = "Loose-File (with optional automation)"

After this, navigate to [this page](https://github.com/KOTOR-Community-Portal/mod-builds/blob/dev/scripts/cleaner.bat) and click on the button with the arrow pointing down at the top of the code list (the one which says \"download raw file\"). Place cleaner.bat in the folder from redrob's mod called \"Copy contents to TSL's Override folder\", then go to [here](https://github.com/KOTOR-Community-Portal/mod-builds/blob/dev/scripts/cleanlist_k2_sf.txt) and repeat the same step, placing cleanlist_k2_sf.txt in the same location. You can now run cleanlist.bat: follow the instructions onscreen, selecting whether you did or didn't use any of the given mods, and the batch file will automatically delete the incompatible files. Once you reach the end of the list, you can exit the .bat window, delete cleaner.bat and cleanlist_k1.txt, and then move the remaining files in the folder to your override.\r\n\r\nIf you cannot run .bat files or feel uncomfortable running this file, you will need to manually delete the files yourself, following the instructions [here](https://github.com/KOTOR-Community-Portal/mod-builds/blob/dev/content/k2/redrob_deletionsk2_sf.md)."

Category = "Graphics Improvement"
Tier = "1 - Essential"
Description = "This mod is a *killer* cutscene improvement mod, using a very clean, very sharp AI pass to upscale and clarify the cutscenes.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there's a price for the quality of Pops's work: the files are extremely hefty, coming in at a whopping 15 gigs. This mod is by far the better of the two cutscene mods available, but if you're on limited data, a poor connection or have limited drive space, it's a much better idea to use naelavok's remastered cutscenes below rather than Pops's version here. If you've got the space and the speed, though, this is where it's at."

Bear in mind that the files from this mod go in your *movies* folder, not override.\r\n\r\nIf you experience issues with the game minimizing during cutscenes, it might be necessary to go to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7euNu1Tt5E) and following the instructions to use RAD tools to \"upscale\" the cutscenes to match your exact resolution, though I have not personally attempted this so I don't know how much time it would take to complete.
