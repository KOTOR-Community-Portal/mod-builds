To an extent that's novel, since it helps make companions feel more unique and less rigidly tied to the D&D system if they can be stronger than what the system otherwise allows. But it becomes less novel when you realize that most of what they did is just make Jedi companions super OP and short most other party members on stats & feats they should have had.\r\n\r\nAs part of the Thematic series of mods by JC and myself, Thematic KOTOR Companions is a rework of companion starting attributes, skills, feats and powers to lock all companions into having the exact amount of bonuses they should for their level, as well as retuning several of their setups to more closely match the characters' behaviors and backstories. The goal is to ensure that companions' statlines are not only thematically consistent, but also broadly mechanically balanced, to better-incentivize the use of under-utilized party members.\r\n\r\nCompanion names, genders, and some information about their backstories have been censored in the attached changes breakdown to avoid spoilers."

Not only have they split the blade texture in two to allow for lightsabers with cores of a different color (currently unsupported in the build release, but hopefully coming soon), they've also added *dynamic reflections* to each and every lightsaber across every area of the game. When you're fighting a Dark Jedi, you're going to see your faces bathed in shifting colors, fading and brightening as you swing your lightsabers; when you ignite your saber in a hallway, it will reflect on the floor and walls, and will realistically increase in intensity as the blade draws nearer to the surface. This is an incredible project, and easily one of the most important—and impressive—mods ever released for KOTOR. In the next few years, it could completely change the face of lightsaber modding."

But it wasn't always so—until quite late in development a very unique ending for Dark Side players who romanced Carth, one of your first companions, was still being developed, and voice lines were even recorded for it. For unknown reasons this ending was cut, but with this mod it has now been restored. You are not locked into this alternate ending, it's only presented as an option which your character may choose. More than this can't be revealed to avoid spoilers, but do note that unless you intend to play as a DS character capable of romancing Carth, this mod will not present any changes. Please also note, in vanilla only females can romance Carth, but a third-party mod by Leilukin not present in this guide makes Carth able to be romanced by male characters, and is compatible with this mod."

Tier = "2 - Recommended"
Description = "This is a meaty mod that makes a lot of changes, and I strongly recommend reading the mod description in detail, but here is a brief synopsis: in KOTOR, repeating rifles (think machine guns) were supposed to be able to make multiple attacks per turn, but this was cut. This mod adds multifire (+1 attack per round) to all *rifles*, and autofire (+2 attacks per round) to *repeaters*, along with an attack (chance-to-hit) penalty to both weapon types, of -4 and -6 respectively. There are two important caveats to this: the rifles change was not something that was originally intended by BioWare (but which I don't find terribly unbalanced, because it helps enemies too); and the multifire and autofire *are not toggles*, they are always on for those weapon types. The mod does have several install options which do not add the multifire to rifles, however, if you don't want the change which BioWare did not intend.\r\n\r\nIf you would prefer a pure damage increase to resolve the discrepancy in repeating rifle price/rarity rather than this multifire option, you can skip this mod and install JC's Blaster Adjustment below. JC's Blaster Adjustment can also be used in conjunction with any install option of Multifire and Autofire."
InstallationMethod = "HoloPatcher"
Directions = "Run the patcher and select your desired install. I personally would recommend using at least one of the first three, as the mod is not worth it for just the feat changes in my opinion. My personal recommendation would be option 2 or 3 (especially if intending to use JC's Blaster Adjustment below), but I tested it with option 1 and did not find it terribly overpowered. Indeed, it made the game way harder at points as enemies were beaming me with multiple rifle attacks, so if you want an extra challenge option 1 is a valid choice."

Tier = "2 - Recommended"
Description = "Although this mod was made as a standalone option to resolve multiple problems with blasters - low blaster base damage, minimal crit chance variety, and weaker repeaters than BioWare intended - it can also be used in conjunction with bdaman's mod above. Long story short, JC's mod takes KOTOR's blasters and (for the most part) gives them the stats of KOTOR 2's blasters, including their more varied critical chances and bonus damage. This takes a weapon type which is extremely limited in its potential in the original game and leaves them viable for players."
InstallationMethod = "TSLPatcher"
Directions = "If you installed the main option of Multifire and Autofire, I recommend using the *Blaster Pistol + Critical* option of this mod, as applying its changes to repeaters and rifles would make them insanely overpowered with their auto-attacks. If using Options 2 or 3 of Multifire and Autofire, I would recommend the *Blaster Pistol & Blaster Rifle + Critical* version of this mod--don't worry, it won't make rifles way stronger; JC's changes to the damage will overwrite bdaman's, in effect just adding JC's alterations to the critical strike ranges. Finally, if not using bdaman's mod, I recommend the full install."

Description = "Redrob is a quiet legend within the scene, who disappears for years and pops back up with projects nobody expects but which become instant classics. Welcome to the latest. This mod is an upscale of virtually all NPC textures in the game, including aliens and some creatures. But that's not all—Rob is skilled with texture work, and although this package uses AI as a base, he's gone over it by hand and corrected, adjusted, and in some cases entirely retextured parts of the textures to eliminate hallucinations, burring or fuzziness, and preserve the original aesthetic of the texture. What's more, Rob's forte is modeling, and he's included a huge series of model adjustments and fixes along with this package which fixes various rendering issues. I can't recommend this package highly enough."
InstallationMethod = "Loose-File (with optional automation)"

Place cleaner.bat in the folder from redrob's mod called \"Copy contents to KotOR's Override folder\", then go to [here](https://github.com/KOTOR-Community-Portal/mod-builds/blob/dev/scripts/cleanlist_k1_sf.txt) and repeat the same step, placing cleanlist_k1_sf.txt in the same location. You can now run cleanlist.bat: follow the instructions onscreen, selecting whether you did or didn't use any of the given mods, and the batch file will automatically delete the incompatible files. Once you reach the end of the list, you can exit the .bat window, delete cleaner.bat and cleanlist_k1_sf.txt, and then move the remaining files in the folder to your override.\r\n\r\nIf you cannot run .bat files or feel uncomfortable running this file, you will need to manually delete the files yourself, following the instructions [here](https://github.com/KOTOR-Community-Portal/mod-builds/blob/dev/content/k1/redrob_deletions_sf)."

This mod is by far the better of the two cutscene mods available, but if you're on limited data, a poor connection or have limited drive space, it's a much better idea to use naelavok's remastered cutscenes below rather than Pops's version here.
