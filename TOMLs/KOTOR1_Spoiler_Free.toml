preambleContent = "# KOTOR 1 Spoiler-Free Build: Mobile Version\r\n\r\n## Installation Notes\r\n\r\n:::warning\r\nImportant\r\n:   If you were linked to this list directly without reading the install instructions, please go back and read them [here](/modding/mod_builds)! There are several critical setup and general best-practice steps you need to be aware of before beginning the install process. The instructions for how this list is installed are located on that page, not this build!\r\n:::\r\n\r\n### General Instructions\r\n\r\nSee [here](/modding/mod_builds/k1/android) for general install instructions for Android, adopted from a reddit thread by Rasral123 with our thanks. You will need to install all mods to the referenced dummy directory on your PC or Mac *first*, then move that completed package over all at once to your phone in order for the builds to apply properly.\r\n\r\nFor iOS users, there is a tentative method to install these mods on an un-jailbroken iOS device [here](/modding/mod_builds/k1/ios).\r\n\r\n### Install Computer Instructions\r\n\r\nThese are instructions relevant to the system which you will be installing these mods on before moving them over to your device.\r\n\r\nIt is critical to ensure that you only have **ONE** installation of KOTOR on your device before beginning. If you have multiple installations, or even just two executables in different locations, mod installers which are set up to auto-detect your installation directory *will* misidentify which one is correct and install the mods wherever they please, probably spiking your whole install in the process. This is particularly important for installing the mobile builds, as I imagine many users will have a PC version of the game installed on the same computer which they are using to set up the mobile builds! For the sake of stability: if you have a copy of KOTOR installed on your device already, compress it to an archive using a program like WinRAR or 7zip, and delete the loose files left over. Then, when the install process is completed, extract the archive where the previous install was located and your local game will be preserved.\r\n\r\nPlease bear in mind that the TSLPatcher executable utilized in the installation process of many of these mods (frustratingly) does not always function on multi-monitor setups. If you have more than one monitor on the device which you're utilizing the dummy directory to install content on, you may need to disable your second while installing the mods, but you can re-enable it once the installation process is complete.\r\n\r\nDo not, under **ANY CIRCUMSTANCES**, run a TSLPatcher or Holopatcher executable from within a file archive (IE a compressed file like a .rar, .zip, .7z, etc). You *must* extract all archives before installing mod content, or running an executable. Failure to extract before installing will break your game. Also, ensure you don't extract installer-based mods to the same folder. If, for example, you extract every single mod to a folder called \"KOTOR Mods\", each time you extract you'll be overwriting critical data from the previous mods. Make sure each installer-based mod is extracted to its own folder before running the installer.\r\n\r\nAs a final note, please bear in mind: if you are asked to direct a TSLPatcher executable to a folder to begin install, that folder should ALWAYS be your 'dummy directory', the folder which contains the Override folder for your modded setup. For mods that are NOT installed with the TSLPatcher, *unless otherwise noted* their loose-file contents are placed directly in the Override directory. Unless you are following specific instructions (the mod author's or my own) that state otherwise, you should not be placing files directly in the dummy directory. You should *never* have any subfolders inside the Modules or Override folders within the dummy directory.\r\n\r\n### Mac OS Users\r\n\r\nIt is *required* to be able to run executable files in order to install this list. A wrapper program like Wineskin or some other option which will allow you to run executable files is necessary in order to proceed."

The goal is to ensure that companions' statlines are not only thematically consistent, but also broadly mechanically balanced, to better-incentivize the use of under-utilized party members.\r\n\r\nCompanion names, genders, and some information about their backstories have been censored in the attached changes breakdown to avoid spoilers."

More than this can't be revealed to avoid spoilers, but do note that unless you intend to play as a DS character capable of romancing Carth, this mod will not make any visible changes. Please also note, in vanilla only females can romance Carth, but a third-party mod by Leilukin not present in this guide makes Carth able to be romanced by male characters, and is compatible with both the mod builds and this mod specifically."

This mod adds multifire (+1 attack per round) to all *rifles*, and autofire (+2 attacks per round) to *repeaters*, along with an attack (chance-to-hit) penalty to both weapon types, of -4 and -6 respectively. There are two important caveats to this: the rifles change was not something that was originally intended by BioWare (but which I don't find terribly unbalanced, because it helps enemies too); and the multifire and autofire *are not toggles*, they are always on for those weapon types. The mod does have several install options which do not add the multifire to rifles, however, if you don't want the change which BioWare did not intend.\r\n\r\nIf you would prefer a pure damage increase to resolve the discrepancy in repeating rifle price/rarity rather than this multifire option, you can skip this mod and install JC's Blaster Adjustment below. JC's Blaster Adjustment can also be used in conjunction with any install option of Multifire and Autofire."

This takes a weapon type which is extremely limited in its potential in the original game and leaves them viable for players."
InstallationMethod = "TSLPatcher"
Directions = "If you installed the main option of Multifire and Autofire, I recommend using the *Blaster Pistol + Critical* option of this mod, as applying its changes to repeaters and rifles would make them insanely overpowered with their auto-attacks.

Description = "For the past two years Morty has been belting out banger mods one after the other, and this mod is no exception. Logically, your repair skill represents your familiarity with machines, and the more you understand something, the easier it should be to break it, right? This mod scales the damage from the Stun Droid power line with your repair, making it more viable while also rewarding the player for skills investment."

Description = "Why is it that, if you've fallen to the absolute depth of the Dark Side, you can throw lightning no more powerful than when you were first beginning to fall? Why is it that, as a paragon of the Light, the strength of your connections changes nothing about the power of the Force you can use to defend yourself? Well, now it does. Be an enlightened Jedi with mighty buffs that last an extended duration, or a fierce Sith Lord whose lightnings are easy to cast and mercilessly damaging. But better still, this mod isn't about a power fantasy—there are consequences that come from aligning strongly with one side, leading to atrophied abilities from the other extreme. It's a well-thought-out design that is well-balanced and feels great ingame while also being logically consistent. In my view, that makes this mod a must-have."

Description = "This is a script written by Flachzangen which allows you to remove duplicate .TGA or .TPC files in your game directory. Files with the .TPC filetype take priority, so for several of the patches we've downloaded which are of the .tga filetype, we need to delete any .TPC duplicates in order to get them to read properly. That's what this script will do.\r\n\r\n:::warning\r\nNote\r\n:   It is **CRITICAL** to use this script, as, if .tpc files take priority in some instances, the game will crash.\r\n:::"
InstallationMethod = ".bat Patcher"
Directions = "Place DelDuplicateTGA-TPC (or the bash script version) in your main game folder (NOT override!), run it, say that **TPC should be deleted** and do not manually confirm. If you are on a Mac or other device that cannot run .bat files and the bash script is not an option for you to use, a list of all the files you will need to manually delete can be found [here](/modding/mod_builds/k1/delete).\r\n\r\n    **MAKE SURE THIS SCRIPT RUNS PROPERLY!** On some operating systems, overzealous antivirus setups, or filepaths with particular characters in them it may fail. If the file outputs \"Finished, Press any key to continue\" but does not list any files it deleted, it *is not working*, and if it does not work it *will* crash your game. You can try to resolve this by moving your Override folder to a different location (I recommend a subfolder in your Documents or Downloads directories), putting the .bat file there and running it through that directory, but if that doesn't work you will need to manually go through and delete the duplicates from the link above."
