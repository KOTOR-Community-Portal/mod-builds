Guid: 4356c3e2-d2d3-4088-8fab-0395c408db0f
Name: KOTOR Dialogue Fixes
Author: Salk & Kainzorus Prime
Description: In addition to fixing several typos, this mod takes the PC's dialogue—which is written in such a way as to make the PC sound constantly shocked, stupid, or needlessly evil—and replaces it with more moderate and reasonable responses, even for DS choices.
Category:
- Immersion
Tier: 1 - Essential
IsSelected: true
Directions: The choice of which version to use is up to you; I recommend PC Response Moderation, as it makes your character sound less like a giddy little schoolchild following every little dialogue, but if you prefer only bugfixes it is compatible. Just move your chosen dialog.tlk file to the *main game directory* (where the executable would normally be)—in this very specific case, NOT the override.

Author: jonathan7, patch by A Future Pilot
Description: In a normal KOTOR start, your character's feats are pre-selected. This mod changes the initial level-up so that the number of feat points given is determined by class, but you can choose the feats you wish to invest into.
Category:

UsageWarning: It's possible, if using auto level-up, to miss the feats to equip weapons and basic light armor while using this mod, unless you use the patch. Make sure to install it!

Name: Thematic KOTOR Companions
Author: Sniggles & JCarter426
Description: >-
  BioWare did a few wacky things with character progression in this game. To an extent that's novel, since it helps make companions feel more unique and less rigidly tied to the D&D system if they can be stronger than what the system otherwise allows. But it becomes less novel when you realize that most of what they did is just make Jedi companions super OP and short most other party members on stats & feats they should have had.


  As part of the Thematic series of mods by JC and myself, Thematic KOTOR Companions is a rework of companion starting attributes, skills, feats and powers to lock all companions into having the exact amount of bonuses they should for their level, as well as retuning several of their setups to more closely match the characters' behaviors and backstories. The goal is to ensure that companions' statlines are not only thematically consistent, but also broadly mechanically balanced, to better-incentivize the use of under-utilized party members.

Description: An ambitious compilation intending to be a comprehensive bugfix mod for the original game, the KOTOR Community Patch combines hundreds of various fixes and improvements from over a dozen other mods, as well as fixes put together by AFP, DP and JC on their own.

Name: Cloaked Jedi Robes
Author: JCarter426
Description: If you preferred the robes in KOTOR 2, as most seem to, does JC have a mod for you. Cloaked Jedi Robes migrates all of the robe types from KOTOR 2 straight into KOTOR, while still managing to retain the unique color schemes of the original (should you choose to use one of the two options for that, anyway!). If you've long sought robe consistency across the two games, look no further.

Author: JCarter426
Description: It's very annoying when you've got your party together and you want to show your swag off with color-coordinated outfits, but the game only gives you gaudy blue robes. Worry no longer! JC has given us a solution in the form of a skilled Trandoshan tailor, who will dye your robes on demand—it's also compatible with Cloaked Jedi Robes! He even has some very well-written and lore-friendly dialogue about current events.

Name: Unique Sith Governor
Author: N-DReW25
Description: This is a mod I specifically requested because, by default, the Sith Governor on Taris uses the same model and texture as many other Sith in the game, and looks very similar to Malak's apprentice, Bandon. I felt that visually differentiating them a bit would make Bandon seem more unique by comparison, and thus this mod.

Name: Sith Uniform Reformation Revised
Author: Heyorange, Sith Holocron, JCarter426
Description: If you ever want a window into incredibly minor things that I think are really cool, this is the cream of the crop. Vanilla KOTOR doesn't really have much rhyme or reason behind differentiating the appearance of the Sith soldiers you encounter, except for rule of cool. This mod makes the clothing of each rank clear and consistent, with an established breakdown of epaulettes, as well as rank and regiment insignias. New, and thanks to Sith Holocron, these textures have also been further enhanced and upscaled to match the rest of the vanilla game's upscales present in the mod builds.

Name: New Lightsaber Blade Models
Author: Crazy34
Description: With this mod, Crazy34 walked into the community, slammed down one of the most impressive mods ever made for this game, and dared us to do better. Not only have they split the blade texture in two to allow for lightsabers with cores of a different color (currently unsupported in the build release, but hopefully coming soon), they've also added *dynamic reflections* to each and every lightsaber across every area of the game. When you're fighting a Dark Jedi, you're going to see your faces bathed in shifting colors, fading and brightening as you swing your lightsabers; when you ignite your saber in a hallway, it will reflect on the floor and walls, and will realistically increase in intensity as the blade draws nearer to the surface. This is an incredible project, and easily one of the most important—and impressive—mods ever released for KOTOR. In the next few years, it could completely change the face of lightsaber modding.

Name: Senni Vek Mod
Author: N-DReW25
Description: The second option of this mod, the Senni Vek Restoration, restores the initial character who leads you to the Geno'Haradan as one of Hulas's henchmen for the showdown on Tatooine, and is fully vanilla-friendly. The default install, Senni Vek's Ambush, removes Hulas from the final confrontation entirely and replaces him with Senni Vek, featuring altered dialogue which implies that Hulas played you for the entire game and has vanished into the shadows to consolidate his control of the Geno'Haradan.

Description: "Originally, swoop bikes in KOTOR were intended to have upgrades available for purchase which would modify their performance. This mod restores two upgrades to the game: one that reduces the speed loss taken when hitting an obstacle, and one which increases acceleration. Right now this mod isn't a perfect implementation of what I'd like, including too few upgrades which are a bit pricey relative to the benefit they give, but I still think it's better for players to have the option to use them than not."

Name: Jedi Choice Dialogue Enhancement

Description: >-
  Sometimes you can really feel the disdain for the 11 year olds who were going to play this game in BioWare's writing. "I want to be a Jedi Guardian!" resonates with the soul-crushing hollowness which my mother must have felt when I was 10 and begged for a gameboy.


  Anyway, this mod makes the whole Jedi sequence more meaningful by getting rid of the childish response and replacing it with a much more nuanced, alignment-based series of replies.

Name: "JC's Romance Enhancement: Dark Sacrifice"
Author: JCarter426
Description: "As you know, with some small variations KOTOR has a binary ending: Light Side or Dark Side. But it wasn't always so—until quite late in development a very unique ending for Dark Side players who romanced Carth was still being developed, and voice lines were even recorded for it. For unknown reasons this ending was cut, but with this mod it has now been restored. You are not locked into this alternate ending, it's only presented as an option which your character may choose. More than this can't be revealed without giving the ending away, but do note that unless you intend to play as a DS character capable of romancing Carth, this mod will not present any changes. Please also note, a third-party mod by Leilukin not present in this guide makes Carth able to be romanced by male characters, and is compatible with this mod."

Name: Saber Throw Knockdown Effect
Author: uwadmin12
Description: By default, the "Throw Lightsaber" power is a little weak. Not only does it seem like it takes forever, it does much less damage in a much smaller AoE than powers like Lightning—or even Wave! The goal of this mod is giving Advanced Throw Lightsaber some additional functionality that makes using it worthwhile, namely the inclusion of a knockdown effect on the primary target if that target fails to pass a saving throw. This can make the ability useful for screening particular zones while also dealing damage—still somewhat less effective than Wave, but with more guaranteed damage.

Name: PC Dialogue with Davik's Slave Change
Author: Leilukin
Description: "2003 was a different time, but this mod *really* proves that. In vanilla, if you request a 'massage' from some slaves—which has some sexual implications in Star Wars—you get nothing more than a disgusted remark from some companions. You can even threaten them without consequence. This mod properly amends this, giving you two options: for those deeply bothered by the ability to take advantage of the slaves the option to pressure them into servicing you can be removed entirely, whereas the second retains the massage, but gives Dark Side points for requesting it, as well as adding DS points for threatening the slaves at any point."

Name: Sith Uniform Reformation
Author: Heyorange
Description: If you ever want a window into incredibly minor things that I think are really cool, this is the cream of the crop. Vanilla KOTOR doesn't really have much rhyme or reason behind differentiating the appearance of the Sith soldiers you encounter, except for rule of cool. This mod makes the clothing of each rank clear and consistent, with an established breakdown of epaulettes, as well as rank and regiment insignias.

Name: Repeating Blaster Attacks Restoration
Author: R2-X2
Description: Blasters in the original KOTOR are underpowered all-around, but out of the entire laughingstock none is worse than blaster repeaters, which cost more in return for equivalent damage and less crit chance. It turns out that these weapons were originally supposed to have two attack rounds, but BioWare didn't have the time or know-how to implement this before the game went gold. This mod restores this function, with only a few instances where it doesn't work due to hardcoded scripting.

Description: "In all BioWare's infinite brilliance, when they ported KOTOR to PC they didn't just cap the menus to 800x600, they also broke security spikes so they're literally unusable. This mod can't fix that, but it can give you a workaround: either some hacky functionality that works just like spikes do, or cold, hard cash in the places where spikes would normally drop."

Name: Weapon Base Stats Rebalance

Name: Logical Datapads
Author: Sdub
Description: Datapad, datapad, datapad, datapad, datapad. You wouldn't be able to tell it by looking at them, but in vanilla those are five different items. No more. This mod logically renames all datapads to actually explain what they are, so you don't risk an aneurism while looking for a specific one in your inventory.

Name: Remove Duplicate TGA/TPC
Author: Flachzangen, bash version by /u/th3w1zard1
Description: This is a script written by Flachzangen which allows you to remove duplicate .TGA or .TPC files in your game directory. Files with the .TPC filetype take priority, so for several of the patches we've downloaded which are of the .tga filetype, we need to delete any .TPC duplicates in order to get them to read properly. That's what this script will do.
Category:
- Patch
Tier: 1 - Essential
IsSelected: true
Directions: Place DelDuplicateTGA-TPC (or the bash script version) in your main game folder (NOT override!), run it, say that TPC should be deleted and do not manually confirm. If you are on a Mac or other device that cannot run .bat files and the bash script is not an option for you to use, a list of all the files you will need to manually delete can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kotor/wiki/k1buildtpcdelete). MAKE SURE THIS SCRIPT RUNS PROPERLY!
