Name=Mobile TSLRCM (The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod)
Author=zbyl2, DarthStoney, Hassat Hunter & VarsityPuppet
Description=The whole reason why you would mod KOTOR 2, the legendary mod that includes bugfixes, restored content, and altered scenes to return the game to what it was meant to be. This mod isn't just essential—it's mandatory.
Category=Bugfix,Immersion,Mechanics Change,Restored Content
Tier=1 - Essential
Language=YES, *but* you must install the version of MTSLRCM which corresponds to your language of choice.
ModLinkFilenames=https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1801-mobile-restored-content-mod-mtslrcm/|https://deadlystream.com/files/file/578-tsl-restored-content-mod/|https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/156EqzmEESrxksm1f0cPl2tMUf-AOUt8Y?usp=sharing
Directions=For now, disregard the installation instructions included in the mod, as we will be dragging over the completed installation in batch. Once the mod is downloaded, extract it to a location of your choice on your PC/Mac and delete everything inside the dlc folder except for the 'mods_*x*' directory, the 'x' corresponding to your language of choice.\n\nYou now need to download [this file](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1321-kotor-2-editable-executable/) and place it within your mods_*x* folder. **This file is critical for future installations to function properly**. This is a dummy .exe file which lets later mods install to the right place on your device, and without error. We will delete it as one of the final steps of this installation process, as it's only needed for installations to function normally.\n\nFrom this point forward all mods are installed as if the mods_*x* folder is the **main game directory**. For any TSLPatcher executable which asks you to select the main game folder/folder with the executable in it, you will select the mods_*x* folder. Similarly, any mods directing you to place their files within the game's override folder will be placed within the override folder within mods_*x*.

Author=Emperor Devon
Description=It's hard to explain this without spoilers—basically, a character confronts your player at a certain point. At the start of this conversation, TSLRCM restores a line which radically changes the tone and impact of the confrontation. Emperor Devon—rightly, I think—concludes that this was content which was cut purposefully rather than for time constraints, and removes the spoken dialogue to restore it to the vanilla standard, where the confrontation begins silently.

Name=Thematic KOTOR 2 Companions
Author=Sniggles & JCarter426
Description=In the original KOTOR, BioWare did a few wacky things with character progression. Obsidian, not wanting to be outdone, decided to be even worse by just straight-up copying the statlines of several KOTOR companions for KOTOR 2 companions!

As part of the Thematic series of mods by JC and myself, Thematic KOTOR 2 Companions is a rework of companion starting attributes, skills, feats and powers to lock all companions into having the exact amount of bonuses they should for their level, as well as retuning several of their setups to more closely match the characters' behaviors and backstories. The goal is to ensure that companions' statlines are not only thematically consistent, but also broadly mechanically balanced, to better-incentivize the use of under-utilized party members.

Name=Prestige Class Saving Throw Fixes
Author=Rovan
Description=In KOTOR 2, the player character can unlock higher mysteries of the Force and achieve a prestige class, which amounts to an upgrade to one of the three default Jedi classes (Guardian, Sentinel, and Consular). For some reason, some prestige classes in KOTOR 2 have worse saving throws than their predecessor class. This mod fixes this, ensuring that the more advanced classes always have slightly better throws.

Name=Classic Class Attack Bonus
Author=Crimson Knight
Description=In the original KOTOR, Soldier and Guardian classes had a 1:1 attack bonus; for every one level, they gained +1 attack. For every other class, this ratio was 1.25:1, which made classes feel different ingame and contributed to a difficulty scale. For unknown reasons, KOTOR 2 did away with this differentiation and gave every class a 1:1 ratio. This mod reverts this, giving classes which aren't explicitly melee-focused the 1.25:1 ratio back, restoring a bit of difficulty to what is otherwise a *very* easy game.

Name=Remote Tells Influence
Author=tk102, patch by Leilukin
Description=This is going to require a bit of an explanation. I personally believe this mod breaks immersion—so why add it? In KOTOR 2, companions have [influence](/faq/k2.html#How_does_KOTOR_2's_influence_system_work)—a mechanic by which the player character can influence their allies, either to align with their views or grow hostile to them. Sadly, KOTOR 2's influence system is asinine. Major plot points are locked behind very high—or very low—influence with several companions. Your influence with companions is also extremely obfuscated, only really discernible by a companion's LS/DS alignment relative to your alignment, but this is a very buggy system which breaks with high Charisma values on the player, or with certain feats. There is no other way ingame to tell what your influence is without this mod. I mark it as optional because it *does* break immersion, but for many players I think having a system to determine influence will be extremely important for enjoyment of the story.

He has pathfinding so bad it would make the worst escort quest target in history blush in embarassment. This mod by Ozils is an outright lifesaver, applying much-enhanced follower logic to the salvager and automatically teleporting him to the party if you get too far away, so you can guide him to where he needs to go very easily.

Name=Enhanced Lightsaber Hilt Variety
Author=J
Description=J's mod here is some more black magic fuckery, finding out a way to make lightsaber "textures" (of a sort) apply both on the legacy patch and Aspyr patch versions of the game, when they were previously broken on the latter. What's more, he's made this mod compatible with JC's lightsaber visual effects above, and also added Crazy34's lightsaber reflections to his sabers, so your (and enemy!) lightsabers will dynamically reflect off of nearby surfaces. The model differentiations here aren't groundbreaking, but they're better than vanilla where all the sabers are entirely the same, especially when you see just how great the reflections look ingame.

Directions=The "No Force Rating" option removes inherent DS alignment bonus to saves in some game areas; these DS bonuses also give equivalent maluses to LS characters in those modules.

Description=This mod can be considered an add-on to SAwL. It does work differently and can be used standalone (I actively recommend using it even if you choose not to use SAwL), but for the most part it is basically a realism/difficulty enhancement to SAwL. It enhances realism by adding a stealth feature to the same challenge which is modified in SAwL, gives the challenge certain Sneak Attack feats (they should logically have had these), and also forces the player and party to actively roll Awareness to detect the threats. This might sound like, combined with SAwL, it would be insane--and, normally, it would be. I recommend using the reduced difficulty option in this mod so you can have the realism without an unsurvivable difficulty spike.

Directions=I recommend the reduced difficulty option if using SAwL, but without SAwL you should be fine to use the full version of this mod, though it will give a similar level of challenge as using SAwL alone. Remember to also apply the compatch for SAwL after running the main install option of your choice, if using SAwL.

Name=For Mandalore!
Author=offthegridmorty
Description=This is a neat mod by Morty which gives the player the ability to summon Mandalorian reinforcements to support them after a certain point in the story, where it makes sense for them to gain access to this support. However normally this would be too overpowered and kind of out-of-place. Morty has however graciously made an install option specifically for use in the mod builds which only adds the Mandalorian support squads to a very narrow and specific sequence lategame, where it makes sense for them to be present and available to come assist the player.

Name=Companion Starting Armors
Author=Ol' Cappy
Description=Giving companions a unique version of their default clothes so they can keep their 'standard' look throughout the entire game while still having mechanically powerful equipment is a very common mod type. I typically don't like these mods, not because I disagree with the premise but because I tend to balk at +10 WIS modifiers on starting gear. Ol' Cappy, in my opinion, does it right here—these are unique clothes for most of the human companions which don't give insane bonuses, but instead small, rational, and most importantly balanced, lore-friendly and internally-consistent bonuses. These items are never going to be the best your team can get, but they are flavorful additions which will let you keep them in their default get a bit longer, if you so choose.

Name=Improved LS Enlightenment & DS Corruption Feats
Author=offthegridmorty
Description=Without spoiling anything about it, KOTOR 2 has a prestige class system: unique classes that give the player certain benefits. The bonuses for two of these specific classes, Light Side Enlightenment and Dark Side Corruption, are really bad. Not only do they only impact a companion's alignment (which is rarely of use to the player), they are also buggy and can overflow, flinging the companion to the complete opposite alignment than they should be! They basically only exist to make things worse. This mod by Morty gives those feats a clear niche: now, instead of impacting companions' alignment directly, it impacts it indirectly by tripling the effects of any influence gain or loss.

Description=Just like its companion mod for KOTOR, this mod is *badass*. Why is it that, if you've fallen to the absolute depth of the Dark Side, you can throw lightning no more powerful than when you were first beginning to fall? Why is it that, as a paragon of the Light, the strength of your connections changes nothing about the power of the Force you can use to defend yourself? Well, now it does. Be an enlightened Jedi with mighty buffs that last an extended duration, or a fierce Sith Lord whose lightnings are easy to cast and mercilessly damaging. But better still, this mod isn't about a power fantasy—there are consequences that come from aligning strongly with one side, leading to atrophied abilities from the other extreme. It's a well-thought-out design that is well-balanced and feels great ingame while also being logically consistent. In my view, that makes this mod a must-have.

Description=This is a script written by Flachzangen which allows you to remove duplicate .TGA or .TPC files in your game directory. Files with the .TPC filetype take priority, so for several of the patches we've downloaded which are of the .tga filetype, we need to delete any .TPC duplicates in order to get them to read properly.

If you are on a Mac or other device that cannot run .bat files and the bash script is not an option for you to use, a list of all the files you will need to manually delete can be found [here](/modding/mod_builds/k1/delete.html).\n\n**MAKE SURE THIS SCRIPT RUNS PROPERLY!** On some operating systems, overzealous antivirus setups, or filepaths with particular characters in them it may fail. If the file outputs "Finished, Press any key to continue" but does not list any files it deleted, it *is not working*, and if it does not work it *will* crash your game. You can try to resolve this by moving your Override folder to a different location (I recommend a subfolder in your Documents or Downloads directories), putting the .bat file there and running it through that directory, but if that doesn't work you will need to manually go through and delete the duplicates from the link above.
