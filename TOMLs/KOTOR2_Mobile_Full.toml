Description = "This is going to require a bit of an explanation. I personally believe this mod breaks immersion—so why add it? The bottom-line is that KOTOR 2's influence system is asinine, and major plot points are locked behind very high—or very low—influence with several companions. Your influence with companions is also extremely obfuscated, only really discernible by their LS/DS alignment relative to your alignment, but this is a very buggy system which breaks with high Charisma values on the player, or with certain feats. There is no other way ingame to tell what your influence is without this mod. I mark it as optional because it *does* break immersion, but for many players I think having a system to determine influence will be extremely important for enjoyment of the story."

You can experience all their content and use them both throughout the entire campaign, as was originally intended by Obsidian.\r\n\r\nBe aware, however, that PartySwap *does* require some fourth wall-breaking elements, including the need to use a script and dialogue window to summon the Handmaiden in order for its party trickery to work. I don't like this any more than you probably do, but I still think having both the Handmaiden and Disciple is far superior to having only one of them, and I think it's an acceptable price for what the mod provides.\r\n\r\nThe mod gives you a stim to manage the Handmaiden and Disciple (spawning & despawning them) which you use to run the script. This stim appears in the *shields* quickbar at the bottom-left of the screen, however; be aware of this, since it doesn't show up in the normal stims category!"
