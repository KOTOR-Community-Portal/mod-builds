preambleContent = "# KOTOR 2 Full Build: Mobile Version\r\n\r\n## Installation Notes\r\n\r\n:::warning\r\nImportant\r\n:   If you were linked to this list directly without reading the install instructions, please go back and read them [here](/modding/mod_builds)! There are several critical setup and general best-practice steps you need to be aware of before beginning the install process. The instructions for how this list is installed are located on that page, not this build!\r\n:::\r\n\r\nAlthough this is a mobile-compatible build, due to required compatibility tools we must use to get this build working, you will need to install all mods to a 'dummy directory' on your PC or Mac *first*, then move that completed package over all at once to your phone in order for the builds to apply properly. This means you **MUST** have a PC or Mac in order to utilize this build for mobile, although you **CAN** install just [MTSLRCM](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1801-mobile-restored-content-mod-mtslrcm/) (the mobile version of The Sith Lords Restored Content Mod) with just your mobile device.\r\n\r\n### Install Computer Instructions\r\n\r\nIt is critical to ensure that you only have **ONE** installation of KOTOR on your device before beginning the installation process. If you have multiple installations, or even just two game executables in different locations, mod installers which are set up to auto-detect your game's installation directory *will* misidentify which one is correct and install the mods wherever they please, probably spiking your whole install in the process. This is particularly important for installing the mobile builds, as I imagine many users will have a PC version of the game installed on the same computer which they are using to set up the mobile builds! For the sake of stability: if you have a copy of KOTOR 2 installed on your device already, compress it to an archive using a program like WinRAR or 7zip, and delete the loose files left over. Then, when the install process is completed, extract the archive where the previous install was located and your local game will be preserved.\r\n\r\nDo not, under **ANY CIRCUMSTANCES**, run a TSLPatcher or HoloPatcher executable from within a file archive (IE a compressed file like a .rar, .zip, .7z, etc). You *must* extract all archives before installing mod content, or running an executable. Failure to extract before installing will break your game. Also, ensure you don't extract installer-based mods to the same folder. If, for example, you extract every single mod to a folder called \"KOTOR Mods\", each time you extract you'll be overwriting critical data from the previous mods. Make sure each installer-based mod is extracted to its own folder before running the installer.\r\n\r\nPlease also bear in mind: if you are asked to direct a TSLPatcher executable to a folder to begin install, that folder should ALWAYS be your 'dummy directory', the folder which contains the KOTOR 2 editable executable, which you will put together during the TSLRCM installation step. For mods that are NOT installed with the TSLPatcher, *unless otherwise noted* their loose-file contents are placed directly in the Override directory. Unless you are following specific instructions (the mod author's or my own) that state otherwise, you should not be placing files directly in the dummy directory. You should *never* have any subfolders inside the Modules or Override folders within the dummy directory.\r\n\r\nAs a final note, be aware that the TSLPatcher executable utilized in the installation process of many of these mods (frustratingly) does not always function on multi-monitor setups. If you have more than one monitor on the system which you're using to install mods, you may need to disable your second while installing.\r\n\r\n### Mac OS Users\r\n\r\nIt is *required* to be able to run executable files in order to install this list. A wrapper program like Wineskin or some other option which will allow you to run executable files is necessary in order to proceed.\r\n\r\n### Updating from a Prior Build\r\n\r\nIf you currently have a prior mod build version installed and would like to update to the current Revision, due to the importance of install order to the mod builds' function, there is unfortunately no way to do so without resetting to a fresh install and reinstalling the new build iteration on top. To do this, just perform the zeroing step listed above: uninstall your game, delete all remaining contents in the game directory (remember, frequently, especially on the Steam release of the game, mod content *will not* be uninstalled as part of the application's uninstallation), and then reinstall the game before applying the new build version.\r\n\r\n### Known Bugs\r\n\r\n* There are significant camera angle errors in the scene where Carth is on the *Sojourn*'s bridge approaching Telos to engage the *Ravager*. We currently don't know why this is and are looking into it actively. The scene still plays properly, including audible dialogue, the camera simply doesn't face the proper direction when doing so."
epilogueContent = "## IMPORTANT: Final Installation Instructions\r\n\r\nFirst, navigate to mods_english's override directory, locate, and delete two files, if they're present: \"CM_baremetal.tga\" and \"CM_baremetal.txi\".\r\n\r\nOnce that's completed, if you did not complete the case sensitivity step, delete the dummy executable file in mods_english which you downloaded at the beginning of the process now. Your install is now complete! You can now connect your mobile device to your system, and move the dlc folder containing the mods_english folder to the install point for your device:\r\n\r\n**iOS**:\r\nOn iOS, they are placed in iTunes > Apps > Documents, in the same spot that the ‘saves’ folder goes.\r\n\r\n**ANDROID**:\r\nOn Android the files should be placed in /Home/Android/data/com.aspyr.swkotor2/files/\r\n"

Your influence with companions is also extremely obfuscated, only really discernible by their LS/DS alignment relative to your alignment, but this is a very buggy system which breaks with high Charisma values on the player, or with certain feats.

You can experience all their content and use them both throughout the entire campaign, as was originally intended by Obsidian.\r\n\r\nBe aware, however, that PartySwap *does* require some fourth wall-breaking elements, including the need to use a script and dialogue window to summon the Handmaiden in order for its party trickery to work. I don't like this any more than you probably do, but I still think having both the Handmaiden and Disciple is far superior to having only one of them, and I think it's an acceptable price for what the mod provides.\r\n\r\nThe mod gives you a stim to manage the Handmaiden and Disciple (spawning & despawning them) which you use to run the script. This stim appears in the *shields* quickbar at the bottom-left of the screen, however; be aware of this, since it doesn't show up in the normal stims category!"

I typically don't like these mods, not because I disagree with the premise but because I tend to balk at +10 WIS modifiers on starting gear. Ol' Cappy, in my opinion, does it right here—these are unique clothes for most of the human companions which don't give insane bonuses, but instead small, rational, and most importantly balanced, lore-friendly and internally-consistent bonuses. These items are never going to be the best your team can get, but they are flavorful additions which will let you keep them in their default get a bit longer, if you so choose."
