To an extent that's novel, since it helps make companions feel more unique and less rigidly tied to the D&D system if they can be stronger than what the system otherwise allows. But it becomes less novel when you realize that most of what they did is just make Jedi companions super OP and short most other party members on stats & feats they should have had.\r\n\r\nAs part of the Thematic series of mods by JC and myself, Thematic KOTOR Companions is a rework of companion starting attributes, skills, feats and powers to lock all companions into having the exact amount of bonuses they should for their level, as well as retuning several of their setups to more closely match the characters' behaviors and backstories. The goal is to ensure that companions' statlines are not only thematically consistent, but also broadly mechanically balanced, to better-incentivize the use of under-utilized party members.",

      "description": "With this mod, Crazy34 walked into the community, slammed down one of the most impressive mods ever made for this game, and dared us to do better. Not only have they split the blade texture in two to allow for lightsabers with cores of a different color (currently unsupported in the build release, but hopefully coming soon), they've also added *dynamic reflections* to each and every lightsaber across every area of the game. When you're fighting a Dark Jedi, you're going to see your faces bathed in shifting colors, fading and brightening as you swing your lightsabers; when you ignite your saber in a hallway, it will reflect on the floor and walls, and will realistically increase in intensity as the blade draws nearer to the surface. This is an incredible project, and easily one of the most important—and impressive—mods ever released for KOTOR. In the next few years, it could completely change the face of lightsaber modding.",

For unknown reasons this ending was cut, but with this mod it has now been restored. You are not locked into this alternate ending, it's only presented as an option which your character may choose. More than this can't be revealed without giving the ending away, but do note that unless you intend to play as a DS character capable of romancing Carth, this mod will not present any changes. Please also note, a third-party mod by Leilukin not present in this guide makes Carth able to be romanced by male characters, and is compatible with this mod.",

This can make the ability useful for screening particular zones while also dealing damage—still somewhat less effective than Wave, but with more guaranteed damage.",

This mod properly amends this, giving you two options: for those deeply bothered by the ability to take advantage of the slaves the option to pressure them into servicing you can be removed entirely, whereas the second retains the massage, but gives Dark Side points for requesting it, as well as adding DS points for threatening the slaves at any point.",
