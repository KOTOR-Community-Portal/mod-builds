To an extent that's novel, since it helps make companions feel more unique and less rigidly tied to the D&D system if they can be stronger than what the system otherwise allows. But it becomes less novel when you realize that most of what they did is just make Jedi companions super OP and short most other party members on stats & feats they should have had.\r\n\r\nAs part of the Thematic series of mods by JC and myself, Thematic KOTOR Companions is a rework of companion starting attributes, skills, feats and powers to lock all companions into having the exact amount of bonuses they should for their level, as well as retuning several of their setups to more closely match the characters' behaviors and backstories. The goal is to ensure that companions' statlines are not only thematically consistent, but also broadly mechanically balanced, to better-incentivize the use of under-utilized party members.\r\n\r\nCompanion names, genders, and some information about their backstories have been censored in the attached changes breakdown to avoid spoilers."

When you're fighting a Dark Jedi, you're going to see your faces bathed in shifting colors, fading and brightening as you swing your lightsabers; when you ignite your saber in a hallway, it will reflect on the floor and walls, and will realistically increase in intensity as the blade draws nearer to the surface. This is an incredible project, and easily one of the most important—and impressive—mods ever released for KOTOR. In the next few years, it could completely change the face of lightsaber modding."

This mod adds multifire (+1 attack per round) to all *rifles*, and autofire (+2 attacks per round) to *repeaters*, along with an attack (chance-to-hit) penalty to both weapon types, of -4 and -6 respectively. There are two important caveats to this: the rifles change was not something that was originally intended by BioWare (but which I don't find terribly unbalanced, because it helps enemies too); and the multifire and autofire *are not toggles*, they are always on for those weapon types. The mod does have several install options which do not add the multifire to rifles, however, if you don't want the change which BioWare did not intend.\r\n\r\nIf you would prefer a pure damage increase to resolve the discrepancy in repeating rifle price/rarity rather than this multifire option, you can skip this mod and install JC's Blaster Adjustment below. JC's Blaster Adjustment can also be used in conjunction with any install option of Multifire and Autofire."

My personal recommendation would be option 2 or 3 (especially if intending to use JC's Blaster Adjustment below), but I tested it with option 1 and did not find it terribly overpowered. Indeed, it made the game way harder at points as enemies were beaming me with multiple rifle attacks, so if you want an extra challenge option 1 is a valid choice."

Category = "Mechanics Change"
Tier = "2 - Recommended"
Description = "Although this mod was made as a standalone option to resolve multiple problems with blasters - low blaster base damage, minimal crit chance variety, and weaker repeaters than BioWare intended - it can also be used in conjunction with bdaman's mod above. Long story short, JC's mod takes KOTOR's blasters and (for the most part) gives them the stats of KOTOR 2's blasters, including their more varied critical chances and bonus damage. This takes a weapon type which is extremely limited in its potential in the original game and leaves them viable for players."
InstallationMethod = "TSLPatcher"
Directions = "If you installed the main option of Multifire and Autofire, I recommend using the *Blaster Pistol + Critical* option of this mod, as applying its changes to repeaters and rifles would make them insanely overpowered with their auto-attacks. If using Options 2 or 3 of Multifire and Autofire, I would recommend the *Blaster Pistol & Blaster Rifle + Critical* version of this mod--don't worry, it won't make rifles way stronger; JC's changes to the damage will overwrite bdaman's, in effect just adding JC's alterations to the critical strike ranges. Finally, if not using bdaman's mod, I recommend the full install."

Be an enlightened Jedi with mighty buffs that last an extended duration, or a fierce Sith Lord whose lightnings are easy to cast and mercilessly damaging. But better still, this mod isn't about a power fantasy—there are consequences that come from aligning strongly with one side, leading to atrophied abilities from the other extreme. It's a well-thought-out design that is well-balanced and feels great ingame while also being logically consistent. In my view, that makes this mod a must-have."

If the file outputs \"Finished, Press any key to continue\" but does not list any files it deleted, it *is not working*, and if it does not work it *will* crash your game. You can try to resolve this by moving your Override folder to a different location (I recommend a subfolder in your Documents or Downloads directories), putting the .bat file there and running it through that directory, but if that doesn't work you will need to manually go through and delete the duplicates from the link above."
