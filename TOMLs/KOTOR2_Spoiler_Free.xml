The bottom-line is that KOTOR 2's influence system is asinine, and major plot points are locked behind very high--or very low--influence with several companions. Your influence with companions is also extremely obfuscated, only really discernible by their LS/DS alignment relative to your alignment, but this is a very buggy system which breaks with high Charisma values on the player, or with certain feats. There is no other way ingame to tell what your influence is without this mod. I mark it as optional because it does break immersion, but for many players I think having a system to determine influence will be extremely important for enjoyment of the story."

Directions = "Before proceeding, delete the dummy executable used to facilitate the mod installations. If the device you're currently using runs a Windows OS, download one of the executable files from the linked github page matching your operating system's architecture (32-bit or 64-bit; google which your Windows OS is if you're not sure), place the file in the main dummy directory which you have created to install the mods to (NOT the override folder), and run the executable.\r\n\r\nIf you are on MacOS or Linux, first, run Terminal and navigate to your mods_english directory with the cd command.\r\n\r\n`cd [full filepath to mods_english on your device]`\r\n\r\nThen, enter the following command:\r\n\r\n`find . -depth | xargs -n 1 rename -f 's/(.*)\\/([^\\/]*)/$1\\/\\L$2/' {} \\;`\r\n\r\nIf you are prompted for permission, rerun the command with elevated privileges using the sudo command.\r\n\r\n`sudo find . -depth | xargs -n 1 rename -f 's/(.*)\\/([^\\/]*)/$1\\/\\L$2/' {} \\;`\r\n\r\nFor more information:\r\n\r\n* [cd command](https://linuxize.com/post/linux-cd-command/)\r\n\r\n* [sudo command](https://linuxize.com/post/sudo-command-in-linux/)"
