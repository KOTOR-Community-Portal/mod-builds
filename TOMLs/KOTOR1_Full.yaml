preambleContent: "# KOTOR 1 Full Build\r\n\r\n## Installation Notes\r\n\r\n:::warning\r\nImportant\r\n:   If you were linked to this list directly without reading the install instructions, please go back and read them [here](/modding/mod_builds)! There are several critical setup and general best-practice steps you need to be aware of before beginning the install process. The instructions for how this list is installed are located on that page, not this build!\r\n:::\r\n\r\n### Zeroing Step\r\n\r\nUnless you have *freshly* installed the game or have never installed KOTOR previously, please blank-slate your setup: uninstall the game, delete the full contents of your game's directory (the entire folder where the executable file previously was located; this does **NOT** always happen automatically when the game is uninstalled), and reinstall the game. The majority of troubleshooting support we offer is due to users who encounter problems resulting from leftover game files or file corruption from a game which was installed many years ago. Performing this zeroing step helps to ensure your local copy is fresh, uncorrupted, and free of any old mod data.\r\n\r\nOnce you have your freshly-installed copy of the game, please attempt to set your main game directory and all subfolders as *not* read-only. This is because executable mods will need to modify the files therein directly to install properly. Some operating systems (particularly Windows OS 8+) will lock the settings on these folders depending on their locations, so for many systems it will not be possible to actually pull them out of their read-only state, but it is important to at at least attempt to change the folders, as on some operating systems it is necessary for a functional install.\r\n\r\n### TSLPatcher Installation Requirements\r\n\r\nDo not, under **ANY CIRCUMSTANCES**, run a TSLPatcher or HoloPatcher executable from within a file archive (IE a compressed file like a .rar, .zip, .7z, etc). You *must* extract all archives before installing mod content, or running an executable. Failure to extract before installing will break your game. Also, ensure you don't extract installer-based mods to the same folder. If, for example, you extract every single mod to a folder called \"KOTOR Mods\", each time you extract you'll be overwriting critical data from the previous mods. Make sure each installer-based mod is extracted to its own folder before running the installer.\r\n\r\nPlease also bear in mind: if you are asked to direct a TSLPatcher or Holopatcher executable to a folder to begin install, that folder should ALWAYS be the main game folder, where your game's .exe file is located (or the symlink to that folder created in the optional Quicker TSLPatching step, discussed further below). For mods that are NOT installed with the TSLPatcher or Holopatcher, *unless otherwise noted* their loose-file contents are placed directly in the Override directory. Unless you are following specific instructions (the mod author's or my own) that state otherwise, you should not be placing files in the game's main directory or Modules folder. You should *never* have any subfolders inside the Modules or Override folders.\r\n\r\nAs a final note, be aware that the TSLPatcher executable utilized in the installation process of many of these mods (frustratingly) does not always function on multi-monitor setups. If you have more than one monitor, you may need to disable your second while installing the mods, but you can re-enable it once the installation process is complete.\r\n\r\n### Single Install\r\n\r\nIt is critical to ensure that you only have **ONE** installation of KOTOR on your device before beginning the installation process. If you have multiple installations, or even just two game executables in different locations, mod installers which are set up to auto-detect your game's installation directory *will* misidentify which one is correct and install the mods wherever they please, probably spiking your whole install in the process. If you want to make a backup of your vanilla gamestate, make sure to compress the entire game into an archive (.rar, .zip, .7z, etc.) before starting the install process.\r\n\r\n### Updating from a Prior Build\r\n\r\nIf you currently have a prior mod build version installed and would like to update to the current Revision, due to the importance of install order to the mod builds' function, there is unfortunately no way to do so without resetting to a fresh install and reinstalling the new build iteration on top. To do this, just perform the zeroing step listed above: uninstall your game, delete all remaining contents in the game directory (remember, frequently, especially on the Steam release of the game, mod content *will not* be uninstalled as part of the application's uninstallation), and then reinstall the game before applying the new build version.\r\n\r\n### AMD Players\r\n\r\nNot long ago many AMD cards experienced extreme and frequent crashing when playing KOTOR. Recent driver updates have fixed this, so if you get into the game and start experiencing random crashes while walking around, the solution should be as simple as updating your drivers. If for whatever reason that doesn't work, you can try reversion instead: the last known stable AMD driver series is [here](https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/release-notes/rn-rad-win-22-5-1), but bear in mind that, if your AMD hardware is newer than this driver's release date, rolling back will not be possible.\r\n\r\n### Mac OS Players\r\n\r\nPlease see [this link](/modding/mod_builds/macos) for installation assistance for the game and these mods.\r\n\r\n### Amazon Games Players\r\n\r\nFor unknown reasons, the Amazon Games version of KOTOR has a modified executable and initiation file which breaks the Miles sound system, and automatically disables both movies and sound. Follow the steps [here](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2377-amazon-gamess-k1-release-soundsmovies-fix/) to restore these features. It's okay to do this now even if you intend to patch widescreen in later, just bear in mind when you do move to patch in widescreen that you already have the editable executable downloaded.\r\n\r\n### Linux Players\r\n\r\nPlease note, case-sensitivity is an issue with many Linux systems (as you may expect). For those not running a case-insensitive distro, you will need to batch-lowercase any mod files--*any* mod files, not just the files that end up in your override directory. It's likely you will need to both lowercase the files before installing any installer-based mod and then again at the end of the process as a batch action in your game directory and all subfolders, as the TSLPatcher/HoloPatcher will generate several files as part of their install processes which will have capitals that are misread.\r\n\r\nMost Linux players appear to be using Proton these days, and for those that do there are some known issues with it, both related to crashes with certain older Proton versions and with rendering issues on newer Proton releases. I don't use Linux and don't feel qualified to try to summarize the issues and fixes here, but just be aware if you run into trouble there are several pins in the [Discord's](https://discord.gg/qw7NhM6EW5) #tech_support channel dealing with Proton and how to resolve both issues (the crashing & rendering problems).\r\n\r\n### Known Bugs\r\n\r\n* For some users, the game may very rarely crash on load when trying to enter a new area due to a data overflow. This is extremeley uncommon and most users should never encounter it, but it is impossible to fully prevent. Fortunately, it is easy to fix if it does happen: simply temporarily disable the 'Frame Buffer Effects' and \"Soft Shadows\" settings in your advanced graphics options, proceed through the load screen, then re-enable the settings once on the other side. Again, most players should never encounter this.\r\n\r\n### Total Filesize on Disk\r\n\r\nFor your reference, the total filesize of all mods before extraction, excluding movies, is approximately 7GB. The total size of the install when extracted, including basegame files but excluding upscaled movies, is approximately 14GB. The total install size plus HD movies (Pops Maellard's set) in 1920x1080 resolution is approximately 25GB. Please bear this in mind if you intend to keep backups and/or are operating on a system with limited available memory.\r\n\r\n## Optional Install Assistant - Quicker TSLPatching\r\n\r\nBecause of the way KOTOR mods install, it's virtually impossible to have a true mod manager/installer hybrid like those you may be familiar with for other games, like MO2 or FOMM. The best we can really get are tools to accelerate installations, of which one is supported for the mod builds.\r\n\r\n### Quicker TSLPatching\r\n\r\n[**Quicker TSLPatching**](https://www.nexusmods.com/kotor/mods/1214?tab=description) is a system workaround (specifically a registry edit) which makes it easier to install mods. This script *will not work* on Mac operating systems (neither Linux, I believe) not running Windows on a partition, but there are some comments in the Posts section of the download page that might offer alternatives that allow it to function properly.\r\n\r\nThis mod features no level of automation, and only serves to speed up the install process of mods installed via the TSLPatcher executable. Mods will frequently use the TSLPatcher to install, and the TSLPatcher often requires you to manually point the installer at your game's base installation directory. Sometimes the patchers do this automatically, but sometimes they fail, which is where this script comes in; it'll create a symlink to your KOTOR and KOTOR 2 install directories direct to your desktop, where the TSLPatcher defaults to pointing, so you only need to scroll down and click the folder to install without navigating through your system's file structure to find the game folder. The script is confirmed safe and once your install is complete you can delete the desktop folders with no problems. To install, you only need to run the script and follow the instructions it presents, choosing your KOTOR directory in the first popup window and your KOTOR 2 directory in the second. If the script does not function for you, check the Posts section of the mod download page to see some alternate suggestions for manually forcing the functionality of the script."
epilogueContent: "## Optional Widescreen & Extended Widescreen Support Mods\r\n\r\nIf you want support for widescreen resolutions above 1280x1024, it's highly recommended that you follow the instructions presented in the following video. By using UniWS, you also avoid many of the issues caused by FlawlessWidescreen, including savegame corruption:\r\n\r\n[KOTOR Widescreen Patch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DSizFARnwyM)\r\n\r\nAlthough the video says otherwise, on some operating systems setting your display scale to 100% can be avoided by right-clicking the application, going to compatibility, selecting Change High DPI Settings, and setting the override to be scaled by the application. If your OS does not allow this function, you *will* need desktop scaling set at 100%.\r\n\r\nAlso note that, upon application of widescreen, *you will need to launch the game directly from the executable from that point on*. This means, for instance, not launching the game through the Steam interface. This is due to the edits made by widescreen which break the handshake between Steam and the executable.\r\n\r\nAfter you've applied UniWS, you can also install the mods below, which further enhance the game's widescreen implementation significantly:\r\n\r\n### Turret Cockpit Widescreen\r\n\r\n**Name:** [Turret Cockpit Widescreen](https://www.nexusmods.com/kotor/mods/1211)\r\n\r\n**Author:** MadDerp\r\n\r\n**Description:** Fixes visual issues in the turret cockpit caused by widescreen showing angles which were never supposed to be visible.\r\n\r\n**Category & Tier:** Bugfix / 3 - Suggested\r\n\r\n**Non-English Functionality:** YES\r\n\r\n**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### HR Menus\r\n\r\n**Name:** [KOTOR High Resolution Menus](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1159-kotor-high-resolution-menus/?tab=comments)\r\n\r\n**Author:** ndix UR\r\n\r\n**Description:** Edits your game's .exe file to allow the in-game menus to be represented at your game's edited resolution rather than the permanent 800x600 of the default port. This will only work on the GoG, 4-disk, MacOS, and UniWS-patched Steam versions of the game; for it to be effective, the game must *already be patched* to your widescreen resolution of choice (IE, make sure you've applied UniWS first)!\r\n\r\n**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 1 - Essential\r\n\r\n**Non-English Functionality:** YES\r\n\r\n**Installation Method:** .bat Patcher with Loose-File Components\r\n\r\n:::note\r\nInstallation Instructions\r\n:   Make a copy of your swkotor.exe (only AFTER having applied the UniWS widescreen patch) and paste it into the extracted mod folder with the .bat file within. Run the .bat file (NOT the .exe!) and input the necessary data. The .bat will generate a new file called swkotor.exe, as well as swkotor.exe.bak—*swkotor.exe is the correct file*, and the file with .bak appended at the end is a backup which you can safely delete. Take the new swkotor.exe file and replace the one in your main game directory with it, then move the HR Menus files for your selected resolution into your override folder.\r\n:::\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### HD UI Menu Pack\r\n\r\n**Name:** [HD UI Menu Pack](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1226-hd-ui-menu-pack/)\r\n\r\n**Author:** ndix UR\r\n\r\n**Description:** While the previous mod allows the in-game menus to display at higher resolutions, it doesn't include the rebuilt icons and UI elements that would make those menus appear functional and sharp at higher resolution. This mod is designed to visually improve all the various menu UI elements so they're clear at the higher resolutions. For all intents, it's a mandatory patch of the above mod.\r\n\r\n**Category & Tier:** Patch / 1 - Essential\r\n\r\n**Non-English Functionality:** YES\r\n\r\n**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Workbench Camera Tweak\r\n\r\n**Name:** [Workbench Upgrade Screen Camera Tweak](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1742-workbench-upgrade-screen-camera-tweak-for-k1/)\r\n\r\n**Author:** Darth Parametric\r\n\r\n**Description:** A camera tweak for running the game at higher resolutions intended to allow you to examine weapon models with a little bit more detail in the Workbench upgrade screen.\r\n\r\n**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 4 - Optional\r\n\r\n**Non-English Functionality:** YES\r\n\r\n**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Pretty Good!

Icons](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1815-pretty-good-icons-for-kotor/)\r\n\r\n**Author:** ajdrenter\r\n\r\n**Description:** A comprehensive upscale of all the various icons in the game. Very well-done and essential for visual clarity while using HR Menus.\r\n\r\n**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 2 - Recommended\r\n\r\n**Non-English Functionality:** YES\r\n\r\n**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod\r\n\r\n:::note\r\nInstallation Instructions\r\n:   I recommend using the .tpc file option. For **THIS MOD ONLY**, do not overwrite when prompted!\r\n:::\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Robe Icons for JC's Cloaked Robes\r\n\r\n**Name:** [HD Robe Icons for JC's Cloaked Jedi Robes](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2303-hd-robe-icons-for-jcs-cloaked-jedis-and-effixs-extra-robes/)\r\n\r\n**Author:** Nehua\r\n\r\n**Description:** Rather than using icons matching the vanilla robe appearances even when using JC's cloaked Jedi robes, this mod adds icons specifically matching the cloaked robes.\r\n\r\n**Category & Tier:** Appearance Change & Graphics Improvement / 3 - Suggested\r\n\r\n**Non-English Functionality:** YES\r\n\r\n**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod\r\n\r\n**Masters:** JC's Cloaked Jedi Robes\r\n\r\n:::note\r\nInstallation Instructions\r\n:   In the \"JC's Cloaked Jedis\" folder, select the files from the version of JC's Cloaked Jedi Robes you utilized. Ignore the Effix folder unless playing with that specific mod.\r\n:::\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Upscaled Computer\r\n\r\n**Name:** [Upscaled Computer](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2025-upscaled-computer/)\r\n\r\n**Author:** Dark Hope\r\n\r\n**Description:** Adds an HD computer interface, really only valuable when playing in widescreen due to menu limitations.\r\n\r\n**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 3 - Suggested\r\n\r\n**Non-English Functionality:** YES\r\n\r\n**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Widescreen Fade Fix\r\n\r\n**Name:** [Widescreen Fade Fix](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1792-kotor-widescreen-fade-fix/)\r\n\r\n**Author:** Doiinko\r\n\r\n**Description:** At modded resolutions, part of the screen fades in at a different speed than the rest of the screen. This simple mod fixes the fade so it's uniform.\r\n\r\n**Category & Tier:** Bugfix / 3 - Suggested\r\n\r\n**Non-English Functionality:** YES\r\n\r\n**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Main Menu Widescreen Fix\r\n\r\n**Name:** [Main Menu Widescreen Fix](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/1173-k1-main-menu-widescreen-fix/)\r\n\r\n**Author:** DarthParametric\r\n\r\n**Description:** Like the turret cockpit, by default the game's main menu isn't intended to be viewed in widescreen. This fix widens the viewing angle of the main menu and moves the smoke effects to the edge of the screen, so the menu appears as it should even in higher resolutions.\r\n\r\n**Category & Tier:** Bugfix / 2 - Recommended\r\n\r\n**Non-English Functionality:** YES\r\n\r\n**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Cutscenes Rescaled\r\n\r\n**Name:** [K1 Cutscenes Rescaled](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/2380-k1-cutscenes-rescaled/)\r\n\r\n**Author:** Pops Maellard\r\n\r\n**Description:** This mod is a *killer* cutscene improvement mod, using a very clean, very sharp AI pass to upscale and clarify the cutscenes. A movie replacer like this is necessary to fix the fullscreen bug which causes forced game minimization when cutscenes play (plus they're just *really* good), so it's hugely recommended to use it whether you experience issues with fullscreen play or not.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there's a price for the quality of Pops's work: the files are extremely hefty, coming in at a whopping 15 gigs. This mod is by far the better of the two cutscene mods available, but if you're on limited data, a poor connection or have limited drive space, it's a much better idea to use naelavok's remastered cutscenes below rather than Pops's version here. If you've got the space and the speed, though, this is where it's at.\r\n\r\n**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 1 - Essential\r\n\r\n**Non-English Functionality:** YES\r\n\r\n**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod\r\n\r\n:::note\r\nInstallation Instructions\r\n:   Choose the resolution option which most closely fits your monitor's screen size during the download process. I *STRONGLY* recommend choosing the 30fps option for that resolution—there have been crashes directly linked to the 60fps versions. When installing, there will be several optional files based on how dialogue in cutscenes are displayed (floating text or not, etc). Which of these you choose is your preference; use the mod screenshots to determine. Bear in mind that the files from this mod go in your *movies* folder, not override.\r\n\r\n    If you experience issues with the game minimizing during cutscenes, it might be necessary to go to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA5l6HVs4Y4) and following the instructions to use RAD tools to \"upscale\" the cutscenes to match your exact resolution, though I have not personally attempted this so I don't know how much time it would take to complete. I would estimate around 8 hours, which is the typical time it takes for the native movies to be scaled to 1920x1080 using the same system, but remember that this would be a fully-automated process.\r\n:::\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n### Remastered Cutscenes\r\n\r\n**Name:** [KOTOR Remastered Cutscenes](https://www.nexusmods.com/kotor/mods/1306)\r\n\r\n**Author:** naelavok\r\n\r\n**Description:** Using predictive AI, reddit user naelavok has upscaled the cutscenes for both games out of their horrendous default resolution, to be much more crisp and viewable. This work was done back in 2019, if you can believe it, and is thus much more limited than Pops's version above. Nevertheless it's still a massive improvement over the default cutscenes, and still fixes the fullscreen bug, if you're experiencing it.\r\n\r\n**Category & Tier:** Graphics Improvement / 4 - Optional\r\n\r\n**Non-English Functionality:** YES\r\n\r\n**Installation Method:** Loose-File Mod with Possible Hex Editing Requirements\r\n\r\n:::warning\r\nKnown Bugs\r\n:   With this movie pack, the title crawl movie is broken and will not play normally. It can be skipped and does not crash the game, but will not display.\r\n:::\r\n\r\n:::note\r\nInstallation Instructions\r\n:   Use only Pops Maellard's cutscenes or this version by naelavok. To install, choose the resolution option which most closely fits your monitor's screen size during the download process. Bear in mind that the files from this mod go in your *movies* folder, not override.\r\n\r\n    If you experience issues with the game minimizing during cutscenes, it might be necessary to go to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA5l6HVs4Y4) and following the instructions to use RAD tools to \"upscale\" the cutscenes to match your exact resolution, though I have not personally attempted this so I don't know how much time it would take to complete.

Basegame Issues & Fixes\r\n\r\n### Crash After Character Creation\r\n\r\nThis is a common issue which users tend to think is caused by the mod builds, but 99.9% of the time you don't have a mod error, and this is a basegame issue. Sometimes the game refuses to load when you have the Frame Buffer Effects setting enabled, so just disabling it in your Advanced Graphics Options ingame will allow you to load the game. This can also get you past loadscreen crashes that may rarely occur later in the game.\r\n\r\n### Character Stuck After Combat\r\n\r\nThis isn't a bug that modding can fix (or cause), it's an engine bug. It's related to the game's framerate being unsynced with your monitor's refresh rate. If you're on a 60hz monitor, you can just toggle v-sync. If you're 144hz or similar, just set your monitor to 60hz manually for the duration of play (and also toggle v-sync).\r\n\r\n### Grass\r\n\r\nIf you have issues with objects disappearing behind grass or grass not rendering properly, [this page](http://steamcommunity.com/app/32370/discussions/0/41973821366855313/) purports to have a fix. I have not tested it personally, but users with grass issues report that it fixes the rendering problems—*however*, they also report that it will render many textures partially transparent. Disabling grass in the .ini will also fix rendering issues with grass, and is what I recommend, but this is an option for those who wish to avoid that, to be taken at their own risk.\r\n\r\n### Swoop Racing\r\n\r\nAlthough I don't recommend staying in compatibility mode for Windows XP SP3 long-term, as it can exacerbate some crashes on load screens (which can be resolved in turn by disabling Frame Buffer Effects in your .ini, though that's not ideal either), sometimes swoop racing can mess up in a way that makes it necessary. If you find your swoop bike floating several meters off the track, exit the game and launch it in compatibility mode for XP SP3. You should be able to race normally, and you can turn off the compatibility mode after the racing segment is over.\r\n"

Name: KOTOR Dialogue Fixes
Author: Salk & Kainzorus Prime
Tier: 1 - Essential
Description: In addition to fixing several typos, this mod takes the PC's dialogue—which is written in such a way as to make the PC sound constantly shocked, stupid, or needlessly and overtly evil—and replaces it with more moderate and reasonable responses, even for DS choices.
InstallationMethod: Loose-File Mod
Directions: The choice of which version to use is up to you; I recommend PC Response Moderation, as it makes your character sound less like a giddy little schoolchild following every little dialogue, but if you prefer only bugfixes it is compatible. Just move your chosen dialog.tlk file to the *main game directory* (where the executable is)—in this very specific case, NOT the override.

Description: >-
  BioWare did a few wacky things with character progression in this game. To an extent that's novel, since it helps make companions feel more unique. But it becomes less novel when you realize that most of what they did is just make Jedi companions super OP and short most other party members on stats & feats they should have had.


  As part of the Thematic series of mods by JC and myself, Thematic KOTOR Companions is a rework of companion starting attributes, skills, feats and powers to lock all companions into having the exact amount of bonuses they should for their level, as well as re-tuning several of their setups to more closely match the characters' behaviors and backstories. The goal is to ensure that companions' statlines are not only thematically consistent, but also broadly mechanically balanced, to better-incentivize the use of under-utilized party members.

Name: JC's Minor Fixes
Author: JCarter426
Tier: 2 - Recommended
Description: KOTOR, like with any game, has a slew of little oversights, or things BioWare messed up by accident. The goal of this mod is to fix most of those small things not addressed in other, larger mods.
InstallationMethod: Loose-File Mod
Directions: 'Move everything from the Straight Fixes, Resolution Fixes, and Aesthetic Improvements folders to your Override. Move everything from the "Things what bother me" folder as well, EXCEPT the files for the Sith uniform changes: N_AdmrlSaulKar.mdl, N_AdmrlSaulKar.mdx, N_SithComF.mdl, N_SithComF.mdx, N_SithComM.mdl, and N_SithComM.mdx (in other words, move all "MAN26" files and the two "plc_kiosk" files at the bottom). The fix in the Bugfix folder will be applied by a later mod, so you can also skip it.'

Name: Ajunta Pall Unique Appearance
Author: Silveredge9, Patch by A Future Pilot
Tier: 2 - Recommended
Description: This mod reskins Ajunta Pall to have a unique appearance that matches the honorary statue in the tomb.
InstallationMethod: Loose-File Mod, TSLPatcher Patch
Directions: For this specific mod *only*, the patch is actually run first! Run the patch and apply its changes, then open the main mod file. ONLY look at the Transparent/Non-Transparent folders within the main file; move your preferred textures from one of those folders to your override, and optionally **also** move the contents of the sub-folders for Sith eyes if desired. You will be prompted to overwrite, and this is normal. Do NOT move any of the files in the main mod folder! Your install is done once you've moved your desired textures from the main mod download.

Name: KOTOR Community Patch
Author: Various Authors; Darth Parametric, JCarter426 & A Future Pilot Collate
Tier: 1 - Essential
Description: An ambitious compilation intending to be a comprehensive bugfix mod for the original game, the KOTOR Community Patch combines hundreds of various fixes and improvements from over a dozen other mods, as well as fixes put together by AFP, DP and JC on their own. With bugfixes as important to KOTOR as TSLRCM's are to KOTOR 2, I can't recommend its use highly enough.
InstallationMethod: HoloPatcher Mod, Loose-File Patch
Directions: Be aware that this mod is installed via the HoloPatcher, a new install method. For your purposes as the enduser, it functions almost identically to the TSLPatcher. Run the installer, then move the files from the patch to your override.

      Before moving the files to the override folder, be sure to delete the following: PFBI01 through PFBI04, and PMBI01 through PMBI04.

Description: >-
  This is the first in a series of high-resolution player heads from Dark Hope, complete with full Dark Side transitions and new player portraits. We aren't going to use all of the HD content she makes—with one exception, I've been careful to only select those I think fit closely with the original design, as well as making enough clear improvements that any aesthetic alterations are acceptable trade-offs for the improved texture quality.


  This specific texture reskins the fifth Asian male head preset, including new facial hair.

Author: DarthParametric
Tier: 2 - Recommended
Description: In vanilla, female Twi'lek's thigh-high boots are painted on the character's texture rather than added to their equipped clothing as an item, which would give them realistic three-dimensional depth and higher resolution. This modder's resource serves to add the boots as an equipped object.

Name: Cloaked Jedi Robes
Author: JCarter426
Tier: 2 - Recommended
Description: If you preferred the robes in KOTOR 2, as most seem to, does JC sure have a mod for you. Cloaked Jedi Robes migrates all of the robe types from KOTOR 2 straight into KOTOR, while still managing to retain the unique color schemes of the original (should you choose to use one of the two options for that, anyway!). If you've long sought robe consistency across the two games, look no further.
InstallationMethod: TSLPatcher Mod
Directions: When installing, use the screenshots provided to determine which robe style you would like to use. Aesthetically, I strongly recommend the Brown-Red-Blue Alternative.

Author: JCarter426
Tier: 4 - Optional
Description: It's very annoying when you've got your party together and you want to show your swag off with color-coordinated outfits, but the game only gives you gaudy blue robes. Worry no longer! JC has given us a solution in the form of a skilled Trandoshan tailor, who will dye your robes on demand—it's also compatible with Cloaked Jedi Robes! He even has some very well-written and lore-friendly dialogue about current events.
InstallationMethod: TSLPatcher Mod
Directions: If you use Cloaked Jedi Robes's 100% Brown option, make sure to install the 100% Brown compatibility patch after the main mod installation (re-run the executable).

Name: Unique Sith Governor

Tier: 3 - Suggested
Description: This is a mod I specifically requested because, by default, the Sith Governor on Taris uses the same model and texture as many other Sith in the game, and looks very similar to Malak's apprentice, Bandon. I felt that visually differentiating them a bit would make Bandon seem more unique by comparison, and thus this mod.
InstallationMethod: HoloPatcher Mod
KnownBugs: For reasons which are currently entirely unknown to us, this mod seems to cause crashes on MacOS, and possibly also Linux. We have isolated it to the model, but have no idea why it's happening. Be warned, you may want to avoid this mod if on either OS!

This mod lets them use the full size of the vanilla texture to map, which makes them look less glaringly low-resolution by comparison.

Name: Sith Uniform Reformation Revised
Author: Heyorange, Sith Holocron, JCarter426
Tier: 2 - Recommended
Description: If you ever want a window into incredibly minor things that I think are really cool, this is the cream of the crop. Vanilla KOTOR doesn't really have much rhyme or reason behind differentiating the appearance of the Sith soldiers you encounter, except for rule of cool. This mod makes the clothing of each rank clear and consistent, with an established breakdown of epaulettes, as well as rank and regiment insignias. New, and thanks to Sith Holocron, these textures have also been further enhanced and upscaled to match the rest of the vanilla game's upscales present in the mod builds.
InstallationMethod: TSLPatcher Mod
Directions: When installing, select the Community Patch-compatible installation, if using the K1CP (you should be). Ignore the other install options.

Tier: 4 - Optional
Description: Presented as an alternative to the other HD companion portrait mods previously listed, as well as those companion pictures modified by some of the above graphics mods. If you prefer a more stylized look to your party selection wheel, this lovely mod is the pick for you. Bear in mind that the Revan portrait is optional, so you can exclude that if you would prefer to keep the PC's portraits vanilla.
InstallationMethod: Loose-File Mod
Directions: Strongly recommend the Lite version—the quality difference is not noticeable, but the filesize footprint of the large versions is huge and could contribute to load errors in multiple modules.

Name: Yavin Station Hangar
Author: WildKarrde
Tier: 4 - Optional
Description: By default when landing on Yavin you leave the *Ebon Hawk* and are placed directly into a hallway, but in the intro movie for Yavin you can see the *Ebon Hawk* landing in a hangar that looks... well, remarkably similar to the Manaan hangar. This mod by WildKarrde brings that hangar to life and integrates it into the station geometry, so you can properly exit the ship and cycle through the airlocks onto the station.
InstallationMethod: Hybrid (TSLPatcher + Loose Files)
Directions: If you would like the forcefield for the hangar to be visible, re-run the installer after installing the main option and also install the visible forcefield option. If using HQ Cockpit Skyboxes, move the files from the resolution folder corresponding to the HQ Cockpit Skyboxes size you utilized to your override, then delete ebo_yab.tga, ebo_yaf.tga, ebo_yal.tga, ebo_yar.tga and ebo_yat.tga from your override. Finally, if you utilize Vurt's "K1 Hi-Res Ebon Hawk Retexture," download [this patch](https://mega.nz/file/QAhhFTzD#rxS91pehFgNP7xFh3DNnNFC1d_YelF43K4-q6mh8xfI) and move its contents to your override.

Name: Revamped FX
Author: olegkuz1997
Tier: 3 - Suggested
Description: >-
  Rather than a supplementary, this mod by olegkuz should be treated as an alternative to HD Fire and Ice & Hi-Res Beam Effects, already listed above. While this mod edits some files they don't touch and vice-versa, for the most part it replaces those textures. If you would like, you can install this mod and simply not overwrite when prompted to keep most of the changes of Fire and Ice HD & Hi-Res Beam Effects while only adding the files from this mod that those mods don't touch, but if you choose to overwrite this mod will be your main graphical edit for FX.


  I'm also looking for opinions about this and whether users prefer it to Fire and Ice HD & HR Beam Effects, so please feel free to drop by the [Discord](https://discord.gg/kotor) and let me know what you think!
InstallationMethod: Loose-File Mod
Directions: I recommend against any of the included optional files.

Name: New Lightsaber Blade Models
Author: Crazy34
Tier: 1 - Essential
Description: With this mod, Crazy has added *dynamic reflections* to each and every lightsaber across every area of the game. When you're fighting a Dark Jedi, you're going to see your faces bathed in shifting colors, fading and brightening as you swing your lightsabers; when you ignite your saber in a hallway, it will reflect on the floor and walls, and will realistically increase in intensity as the blade draws nearer to the surface. This is an incredible project, and easily one of the most important—and impressive—mods ever released for KOTOR.
InstallationMethod: TSLPatcher Mod

Name: Senni Vek Mod
Author: N-DReW25
Tier: 3 - Suggested
Description: The second option of this mod, the Senni Vek Restoration, restores the initial character who leads you to the Geno'Haradan as one of Hulas's henchmen for the showdown on Tatooine, and is fully vanilla-friendly. The default install, Senni Vek's Ambush, removes Hulas from the final confrontation entirely and replaces him with Senni Vek, featuring altered dialogue which implies that Hulas played you for the entire game and has vanished into the shadows to consolidate his control of the Geno'Haradan.
InstallationMethod: HoloPatcher Mod
Directions: For realism I personally recommend the "Senni Vek's Ambush" install, but if you'd like to remain as close to vanilla as possible, choose the Senni Vek Restoration instead.

Author: Leilukin
Tier: 3 - Suggested
Description: Most of the Twi'lek textures used in the game are very samey, ultimately boiling down to just a few alternate textures. This mod makes use of alternate textures created as a modder's resource to significantly differentiate the appearances of many unique Twi'lek NPCs.
InstallationMethod: HoloPatcher Mod
Directions: Run the installer first. Once completed, move the upscaled textures to override (if desired). If using the original necks option of Ashton Scorpius's Better Twi'lek Males mod, also ensure to move the files in the "Optional - Original Necks" folder. If using the Senni Vek Mod, ensure to also re-run the installer and select the compatibility patch for whichever version of that mod you've chosen to use (Senni Vek's Ambush or Senni Vek Restoration).

Description: "Originally, swoop bikes in KOTOR were intended to have upgrades available for purchase which would modify their performance. This mod restores two upgrades to the game: one that reduces the speed loss taken when hitting an obstacle, and one which increases acceleration. Right now this mod isn't a perfect implementation of what I'd like, including too few upgrades which are a bit pricey relative to the benefit they give, but I still think it's better for players to have the option to use them than not."

  Sometimes you can really feel the disdain for the 11 year olds who were going to play this game in BioWare's writing. "I want to be a Jedi Guardian!" resonates with the soul-crushing hollowness which my mother must have felt when I was 10 and begged for a gameboy.


  Anyway, this mod makes the whole Jedi sequence more meaningful by getting rid of the childish response and replacing it with a much more nuanced, alignment-based series of replies.

Guid: 63584990-f5ef-40bc-a8a8-2aadf8362576
Name: "JC's Romance Enhancement: Dark Sacrifice"
Author: JCarter426
Tier: 1 - Essential
Description: "As you know, KOTOR has a binary ending: Light Side or Dark Side. But it wasn't always so—until quite late in development a very unique ending for Dark Side players who romanced Carth was still being developed, and voice lines were even recorded for it. For unknown reasons this ending was cut, but with this mod it has now been restored. You are not locked into this alternate ending, it's only presented as an option which your character may choose. More than this can't be said without giving the ending away, but do note that unless you intend to play as a DS character capable of romancing Carth, this mod will not make any visible changes. Please also note, a third-party mod by Leilukin not present in this guide makes Carth able to be romanced by male characters, and is compatible with both the mod builds and this mod specifically."

Guid: 8427fc4d-8c92-4ffc-9357-bbe35b970735
Name: Saber Throw Knockdown Effect
Author: uwadmin12
Tier: 2 - Recommended
Description: By default, the "Throw Lightsaber" power is a little weak. Not only does it seem like it takes forever, it does much less damage in a much smaller AoE than powers like Lightning—or even Wave! The goal of this mod is giving Advanced Throw Lightsaber a knockdown effect on the primary target if that target fails to pass a saving throw. This can make the ability useful for screening particular zones while also dealing damage—still somewhat less effective than Wave, but with more guaranteed damage.

Name: PC Dialogue with Davik's Slave Change
Author: Leilukin
Tier: 2 - Recommended
Description: "2003 was a different time, but this mod *really* proves that. In vanilla, if you request a 'massage' from some slaves—which has some sexual implications in Star Wars—you get nothing more than a disgusted remark from some companions. You can even threaten them without consequence. This mod properly amends this, giving you two options: for those deeply bothered by the ability to take advantage of the slaves the option to pressure them into servicing you can be removed entirely, whereas the second retains the massage, but gives Dark Side points for requesting it, as well as adding DS points for threatening the slaves at any point."
InstallationMethod: TSLPatcher Mod
Directions: I personally recommend option 2.

Author: LDR
Tier: 2 - Recommended
Description: "It's difficult for me to talk about this mod without gushing about it. In my opinion, this mod is the *best* piece of added quest content ever made for either KOTOR or KOTOR 2: best-written, best-structured, best-balanced, best-voiced, and most sensible. It brings the player's past into the equation without mandating anything about their nature, and provides a real and immersive look at what your character's past was, and future could be, all while being lore-friendly to **BOTH** KOTOR 2 and The Old Republic. The only reason this mod isn't marked as Essential is because it reuses one module in a way which doesn't allow for suspension of disbelief—everything else about this mod is perfect."

Name: Sentinel Sneak Attack with Multiclassing
Author: darthbdaman
Tier: 2 - Recommended
Description: No matter how you slice it, Sentinel kind of sucks in KOTOR. It's a game where skills don't matter much, and in those rare instances where you do need them your party can always cover for you. It has a niche, but it's a niche that's useless. This mod endeavors to change that by giving Sentinels sneak attack die every 4 levels, which can even be gained on top of existing sneak attack die from the player's base class. This gives Sentinels more than just an out-of-combat niche to operate in.

Author: Revanator
Tier: 2 - Recommended
Description: As much as I'd like to think that Malak is just too lazy to care, it's unlikely he'd let Bastila run around with the same pseudo-robes she used as a Jedi without marking her as subservient to the Dark Side. This mod adds a new, slick dark-themed version of Bastila's clothing which she receives for the temple mount encounter and beyond.
InstallationMethod: TSLPatcher Mod
Directions: Use the regular install—other install variants have been linked to sequence breaks, but the normal install variant is fully functional.

Tier: 2 - Recommended
Description: The "crowd" in the Taris Dueling Arena is, by default, just a few sprites stuffed in the background. They look awful, and I bet they looked awful even in 2003. Blessedly, this mod fixes that by switching the sprites out with a much more dense crowd, as well as fixing other miscellaneous issues with the arena.

Author: Thrak Farelle, edited by A Future Pilot
Tier: 3 - Suggested
Description: Since Selven can be killed as a government contract with no DS points gained, why can't Bendak? This mod allows the player to decide whether they're agreeing to the death match just because they want blood (DS) or because they simply want to ensure Bendak doesn't kill anyone else (LS).
InstallationMethod: Loose-File Mod
Directions: This mod is not a file archive unlike all the other mods you've downloaded, just a single pre-extracted file. When you get the file, just put it directly in your Override folder.

Author: DarthParametric
Tier: 2 - Recommended
Description: By default, the forcefield in the Kashyyyk shadowlands doesn't have any point of interaction to it, and so to get around this oversight BioWare had to use some camera trickery to prevent the player from seeing what Jolee was doing. This mod fixes this, as well as some other issues with the area, allowing the area transition to work with a more normal camera angle.

Description: In the vanilla version of KOTOR that shipped, there is actually a romance option for female characters and Juhani, though it's tough as sin to proc due to a myriad of bugs (fixed by the K1CP in this mod package). Even so, it's very underdone and has no real conclusion to speak of. This mod's goal is to at least provide some basic closure to the romance and confirm that yes, you did actually proc it properly.

Guid: dfd30c26-60b3-4163-aa8a-a17ca226ca9e
Name: Multifire and Autofire and Finesse
Author: darthbdaman
Tier: 2 - Recommended
Description: >-
  This is a meaty mod that makes a lot of changes, and I strongly recommend reading the mod description in detail, but here is a brief synopsis: in KOTOR, repeating rifles (think machine guns) were supposed to be able to make multiple attacks per turn, but this was cut. This mod adds multifire (+1 attack per round) to all *rifles*, and autofire (+2 attacks per round) to *repeaters*, along with an attack (chance-to-hit) penalty to both weapon types, of -4 and -6 respectively. There are two important caveats to this: the rifles change was not something that was originally intended by BioWare (but which I don't find terribly unbalanced, because it helps enemies too); and the multifire and autofire *are not toggles*, they are always on for those weapon types. The mod does have several install options which do not add the multifire to rifles, however, if you don't want the change which BioWare did not intend.


  If you would prefer a pure damage increase to resolve the discrepancy in repeating rifle price/rarity rather than this multifire option, you can skip this mod and install JC's Blaster Adjustment below. JC's Blaster Adjustment can also be used in conjunction with any install option of Multifire and Autofire.
InstallationMethod: TSLPatcher
Directions: Run the patcher and select your desired install. I personally would recommend using at least one of the first three, as the mod is not worth it for just the feat changes in my opinion. My personal recommendation would be option 2 or 3 (especially if intending to use JC's Blaster Adjustment below), but I tested it with option 1 and did not find it terribly overpowered. Indeed, it made the game way harder at points as enemies were beaming me with multiple rifle attacks, so if you want an extra challenge option 1 is a valid choice.

Guid: 009e60f5-f78f-48f8-8dab-1ee37b128e7e
Name: JC's Blaster Adjustment
Author: JCarter426
Tier: 2 - Recommended
Description: Although this mod was made as a standalone option to resolve multiple problems with blasters - low blaster base damage, minimal crit chance variety, and weaker repeaters than BioWare intended - it can also be used in conjunction with bdaman's mod above. Long story short, JC's mod takes KOTOR's blasters and (for the most part) gives them the stats of KOTOR 2's blasters, including their more varied critical chances and bonus damage. This takes a weapon type which is extremely limited in its potential in the original game and leaves them viable for players.
InstallationMethod: TSLPatcher
Directions: If you installed the main option of Multifire and Autofire, I recommend using the *Blaster Pistol + Critical* option of this mod, as applying its changes to repeaters and rifles would make them insanely overpowered with their auto-attacks. If using Options 2 or 3 of Multifire and Autofire, I would recommend the *Blaster Pistol & Blaster Rifle + Critical* version of this mod--don't worry, it won't make rifles way stronger; JC's changes to the damage will overwrite bdaman's, in effect just adding JC's alterations to the critical strike ranges. Finally, if not using bdaman's mod, I recommend the full install.

Name: Alignment Affects Force Powers
Author: offthegridmorty
Tier: 1 - Essential
Description: Why is it that, if you've fallen to the absolute depth of the Dark Side, you can throw lightning no more powerful than when you were first beginning to fall? Why is it that, as a paragon of the Light, the strength of your connections changes nothing about the power of the Force you can use to defend yourself? Well, now it does. Be an enlightened Jedi with mighty buffs that last an extended duration, or a fierce Sith Lord whose lightnings are easy to cast and mercilessly damaging. But better still, this mod isn't about a power fantasy—there are consequences that come from aligning strongly with one side, leading to atrophied abilities from the other extreme. It's a well-thought-out design that is well-balanced and feels great ingame while also being logically consistent. In my view, that makes this mod a must-have.
InstallationMethod: TSLPatcher
Directions: Ignore the Patch folder unless using K2 Force Powers for K1 (untested, but should function). I strongly recommend the combined install of "Alignment Affects Force Powers + Treat Injury Affects Force Healing."

Name: Remove Duplicate TGA/TPC
Author: Flachzangen, bash version by /u/th3w1zard1
Tier: 1 - Essential
Description: >-
  This is a script written by Flachzangen which allows you to remove duplicate .TGA or .TPC files in your game directory. Files with the .TPC filetype take priority, so for several of the patches we've downloaded which are of the .tga filetype, we need to delete any .TPC duplicates in order to get them to read properly. That's what this script will do.


  :::warning

  Note

  :   It is **CRITICAL** to use this script, as, if .tpc files take priority in some instances, the game will crash.

  :::
InstallationMethod: .bat Patcher
Directions: >-
  Place DelDuplicateTGA-TPC (or the bash script version) in your main game folder (NOT override!), run it, **say that TPC should be deleted** and do not manually confirm. If you are on a Mac or other device that cannot run .bat files and the bash script is not an option for you to use, a list of all the files you will need to manually delete can be found [here](/modding/mod_builds/k1/delete).

      **MAKE SURE THIS SCRIPT RUNS PROPERLY!** On some operating systems, overzealous antivirus setups, or filepaths with particular characters in them it may fail. If the file outputs "Finished, Press any key to continue" but does not list any files it deleted, it *is not working*, and if it does not work it *will* crash your game. You can try to resolve this by moving your Override folder to a different location (I recommend a subfolder in your Documents or Downloads directories), putting the .bat file there and running it through that directory, but if that doesn't work you will need to manually go through and delete the duplicates from the link above.

Name: Ultimate Character Overhaul Patches
Author: ShiningRedHD
Tier: 1 - Essential
Description: This is the point at which we're going to install all the various patches produced for the Ultimate Character Overhaul for any of the other texture mods which you've installed.
InstallationMethod: Loose-File Mod
Directions: Scroll down to the "optional files" section of the mod page. In order, install the compatch for JC's Minor Fixes, the K1CP (delete "PLC_SSldCrps.tpc". Additionally delete N_CommM01 - 06, plus N_CommM08, if using Dark Hope's male clothing upscale. Only then move the files to your override), and then all remaining content that matches content you chose to use from the builds (again, skipping Better Twi'lek Male Heads, if using Leilukin's mod). I also recommend against using the patch for JC's Mandalorian Armor, as there are better options (in my opinion) in Character Textures & Model Fixes below. If using Thigh-High Boots for Twi'lek, only move the patch content from the NPC Replacement folder. If using Republic Soldier's New Shade, use the New Shade option.

Guid: 31f23049-20bf-41d3-85ec-7e97738a9da7
Name: Character Textures & Model Fixes
Author: Redrob41
Tier: 1 - Essential
Description: This mod is an upscale of virtually all NPC textures in the game, including aliens and some creatures. But that's not all—Rob is skilled with texture work, and although this package uses AI as a base, he's gone over it by hand and corrected, adjusted, and in some cases entirely retextured parts of the textures to eliminate hallucinations, burring or fuzziness, and preserve the original aesthetic of the texture. What's more, Rob's forte is modeling, and he's included a huge series of model adjustments and fixes along with this package which fixes various rendering issues. I can't recommend this package highly enough.
InstallationMethod: Loose-File (with optional automation)
Directions: >-
  If you are on a system which can run .bat files, I *strongly* recommend using the automated system to deal with compatibility for this mod. To do so, first extract redrob's mod from its archive, then go to [this page](https://github.com/KOTOR-Community-Portal/mod-builds/blob/main/scripts/cleaner.bat) and click on the button with the arrow pointing down at the top of the code list (the one which says "download raw file"). Place cleaner.bat in the folder from redrob's mod called "Copy contents to KotOR's Override folder", then go to [here](https://github.com/KOTOR-Community-Portal/mod-builds/blob/main/scripts/cleanlist_k1.txt) and repeat the same step, placing cleanlist_k1.txt in the same location. You can now run cleanlist.bat: follow the instructions onscreen, selecting whether you did or didn't use any of the given mods, and the batch file will automatically delete the incompatible files. Once you reach the end of the list, you can exit the .bat window, delete cleaner.bat and cleanlist_k1.txt, and then move the remaining files in the folder to your override.

      If you cannot run .bat files or feel uncomfortable running this file, you will need to manually delete the files yourself, following the instructions [here](https://github.com/KOTOR-Community-Portal/mod-builds/blob/main/content/k1/redrob_deletions.md).

Guid: b6614853-9e10-4807-a32b-81acbfcca9d1
Name: 4GB Patcher
Author: Daniel Pistelli
Tier: 1 - Essential
Description: This is a program which modifies your game's executable file to be able to utilize up to 4 gigabytes of RAM, since KOTOR is a 32-bit application and by default can only utilize 2 gigabytes. This will help the game run smoothly even with the larger texture throughput this build creates, and also reduces issues caused by a memory leak which is native to the game, preventing crashes and savegame corruption.
InstallationMethod: Executable
Directions: >-
  If you intend to add widescreen support, *proceed to the below section and* **FULLY** *apply your chosen widescreen resolution* **AND** *all additional widescreen support mods you choose to use* **BEFORE** *completing this step*. Once you are done applying all your chosen widescreen content, you are then free to apply this patch.

      Additionally, **DO NOT** apply this step with the Steam version of the game, unless you have applied the below widescreen patch! Without the modified widescreen .exe, Steam's executable copy is encrypted in such a way that executing this patcher will break it and prevent the game from launching. Although it's unfortunate to not have access to the patch, it doesn't introduce any fatal errors or shortcomings if you are on Steam and choose not to apply widescreen so it can be used; I recommend just being sure to exit your game and restart the application from the top once every four hours or so!
